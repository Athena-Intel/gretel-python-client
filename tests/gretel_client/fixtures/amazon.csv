"This one of my favorite albums. If you like Green Day or Blink, or just wnat to listen to some awsome pop/punk music, I suggest that you go out and by this album. I also suggest that you go out and see MEST aoon. I've seen them twice and they put on a kick-butt... show."
"A waste of time.Glory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world, and they don't.Don't bother, a nice tape to record over.And the last time I buy a film because Brandon Frazier is in it. Naked or not!"
TWO PLAYAS PLAYING HARD TO GET WITH EACH OTHER MORRIS CHESTNUT AND VIVICA A. FOX PLAY GAMES WITH EACH OTHER . THIS IS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BEST GAME I ENJOYED IT AND I LIKED IT A LOT. IF YOU LIKE COMEDY AND IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ANY OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS MOVIE.
this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
This book along with all other books and seminars on tech analysis are mere ploys to make the authors wealthy.
"This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No, such a short book is only so comphrensive. But it manages to impart a lot of knowledge nonetheless and anyone who thinks they know a lot about guns should study the experts. See alsoThe Seven Myths of Gun Control: Reclaiming the Truth About Guns, Crime, and the Second Amendment."
I thought that Of Mice and Men was a pretty good book. It told a story of a relationship between two friends. If you don't like cussing in a book then this is not the one to read. Otherwise it was really good.
"I think that this is one of the best CD's ever. I really like the song ""Gravity"" and ""Next Time"". Those are the best songs on the CD. Everone should get this CD. It is a must."
"I could hardly believe this film was being high-listed for possible DVD release during the Amazon.com voting... let's be honest, it is not that good a movie (neither acting nor plot nor cinematography), unless you have an intense need to see some gymnastics and Kurt Thomas. But do make a point of reading VICSARJOO's review, for a delicious satire of over-blown and mis-guided reviews. If you enjoy that review (one of my favorites) there are some other classics by him if you link to his other reviews, though some seem a little half-hearted compared to this review by him. Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is another fine example of his dry wit. Thank you VICSARJOO for making me smile."
"A warm and rather lighthearted movie that is pleasing to most tastes and obviously uplifting to the vast majority of reviewers here at Amazon. Not a whole lot of character development throughout the movie, but the characters are rather endearing nonetheless. Some will be skeptical as to the plausibility of such a prison set up, but it was refreshing to see an approach to incarceration that offers some real rehabilitation and redemption."
"No one is perfect but a non-fiction is no use if you cannot trust the accuracy of the information in it. In Mistresses of Mayhem, Ms. Hornberger makes mistakes so blatant that it calls the whole book into question. One wonders if she did any research at all or just read up on the criminals on the Court Tv Website. She misnames Countess Elizabeth Bathory (the so-called female Dracula) as Bathroy. (No it is not a typo. It is spelled that way all through the book.) In the famous Diane Downs case already well documented by Ann Rule in Small Sacrifices and made into a tv movie seen by many, she misidentifies the daughter who died as Christie who might be surprised by this since Christie not only survived but testified against her mother. (Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial.) Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes. Good research would have made proofreading and this review unnecessary."
"Not as soft as Pampers Swaddler, but I prefer them to the regular Huggies and like them equally as the Huggies Little Snugglers which are much more expensive. Very absorbent, never got a leak with them and my baby sleeps for 12 hours at night."
Rod is always good. I liked this because of the songs. Not a bad one on it. He did good. Good driving music.
"These are the best-known ""hits"" from the best-loved shows -- the songs you go home humming -- and Michael's gorgeous and evocative voice really delivers the goods. Love this tour of great moments on stage."
"Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me."
These pajamas last only two months before the silk started to tear at the waist and in the crotch area. For this price I would expect that they would have been much better quality and last longer than two months.
"Snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet, dismal, cold and foggy weather of the region. Utterly depressing.The plot is plodding and stale. No surprises.None of the characters can one identify or sympathise with. That every group is bigoted is nothing new.The ending not worth waiting for.Scenery is lovely as usual but the only redeeming feature of this film is that it portrays the region as it was that began dying out as I was born. The lumber industry and fishing are no longer what they once were. The ferry boats and strawberry fields are still there but tourism is now the biggy."
"This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery, cowardice,guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities.The narrative can be a bit confusing at times as Marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with Jim. The book reminded very much of Somerset Maugham's THE RAZOR""S EDGE"" in style. However I believe that Maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story. Overall LORD JIM is a wonderful classic novel that I highly recommend."
aaahhhh this movie sticks with you and is total classic comedy. from basic humor of just wierd names to the eternal red stapler this is an amazingly hilarious movie. i have never even been inside a cubicle (thank god) and i think this movie may have influenced that. milton certainly steals the show and then i see the same actor on a csi episode and realize he can talk normally and HAS NO RED STAPLER??? *GASP* but anyway...anyone can enjoy this movie whether they are a cubie with a tyrant boss or standing in the unemployment line. this is a new CLASSIC in my book.
"I am now a devoted Jean Warren fan! 1-2-3 Math is great for the under 5 set! I have two children, 4 and 2, and they both have gained so much from the easy activities in this book!"
"This film really made me angry and pissed off I bothered watching it. The characters were cardboard and I can't believe Ingrid Bergman starred in this junk.The main character totally lost it, believing all what her husband was saying about her. She was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con."
"Fans either love or hate this album. I fall into the later category for this is without doubt the worst Iggy Pop album, and quite probably one of the worst rock and roll albums ever recorded, bar none. The songs are unimaginative, the musicianship lacking and most amazing of all is that the production is completely incompetent, amazing considering super producer Don Was handles these chores. It surprizing that this didn't completely kill Iggy's recording career. A prime example is the cover of ""Shaking All Over"". The song shows potential then never takes flight, instead stalling and crashing big time. The Who never imagined the song this way, and with good reason. And its among the better efforts on the album. Try as I might, I just can't listen to more than a few minutes at a time. It is that bad."
"THERE IS NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF SONGS,NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED BEFORE.THE SONGS HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME AND ARE CLASSIC PERFORMANCES BY THE MOST CLASSIC ENTERTAINER OF ANY GENRE OF ALL TIME.IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE A COLLECTION OF THESE SONGS I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS SET AND ENJOY THE FEEL GOOD MUSIC.THERE IS ONLY ONE ELVIS ."
I watched it and thought of it as just bad. I am speechless it's just bad please don't watch this movie.
"Unlike most of the reviews here, I was able to play this HD DVD without any problems. I use my Xbox 360 to play HD DVDs, which is able to automatically get any updates that are needed.Anyway, the movie follows the stories of multiple Italian people, all of different ages and background, as they embark on different milestones in their lives. The video is full of beautiful shots with great hi-def detail. The narration really adds to the video as none of the people speak English.I definitely would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Italy. My wife and I went there a few years ago and were happy to once again see places that we had visited."
"I'm not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price. It doesn't get all my hair out, but it gets 95% of it after a few passes. I think with any epilator, it's gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn't grow back as fast, and comes back finer it is sooo worth it. The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don't give up, it gets better! Also, I've noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer. Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me."
"I always love delving into a well-written, even complex book and getting into the minds of the characters. I was not bored or disappointed at all by this book. It is a book that will appeal to those who feel caught between ""irony and faith,"" or for people who are searching for truth and something to give a lonely life fulfillment."
"I give this book two stars because it's the first, and last, book to tell us what we already should know...that we think gibberish in that ethereal state between waking and sleep. Finningan's Wake reminds me of the canvas I've seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint. Any one of us could create the same thing. Why don't we? Joyce is challenging us to get off our duffs and splatter some paint on the canvass. If you think it's worthwhile (personally, I don't) do it. You could be the next James Joyce."
"This is a blanket review of all 17 books in this series, the first being The Neon Rain. JLB is the definitive of Mystery/Crime writers when he developed the character Dave Robichaeux, a Cajun Homicide detective who started his career in New Orleans and eventually semi retired in New Iberia, LA. The stories are strong, sensitive, moral and above that hypnotic in a sense where you are in the story literally (if your hooked on it). Highly recommended along with his other series of books."
"Yes my friends of this great indstry, this is one of theworld's finest albums of the decade 1990. For so long metalhas been classified in a devilish class of its own. But to bringlight in this world of maddness, this group does indeed bring""spiritual healing"" in there heavenly ""dark"" sound! this groupdoes not exist anymore, so anything that you buy of this bandis a collector's piece! Don't delay on the purchase of this foryou will miss out on a treat. If you are in to dark and evilsounds, but do go to church, you need to get this gift fromGOD, for this is your album filled with the truth. If you arethe other guy, still don't miss out on some good music!!Big Nutt"
"The book arrived in excellent condition. It was a fast enjoyable read. Although, I feel the contents were geared to a woman no older than forty."
"AFTER RECIVING THE 7TH SEASON SET AND IT WOULD NOT WORK...I MADE A SHORT PHONE CALL AND HAD A REPLACEMENT THE VERY NEXT DAY...WOW, WHAT SERVICE....MY GRAND-DAUGHTER ALSO THANKS YOU!!!"
"I am sure there are many reviews for this book already, but I will heap more praise upon Tolkien's genius. The Hobbit relates the reader to the character. The story is also adventurous and exciting. I remember the first time I read the book in fifth grade, it thrilled me then, as it thrills me now when reading for the third time. A land of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, and wizards. The adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time. After reading the rest of Tolkien's books, I appreciate the Hobbit even more. It is a small part of his work, but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding."
"The rolling stones are making the same music from 20 ago....and now..as multi-millionaries, they are playing to rebels..writting songs about bush etc...Ths is the only way to call the media attention?"
"I rated this one quite generously. That one star was awarded just to Santana's name because this music almost makes me feel cheated.Santana, in my opinion, is one of the greatest gutarists of all time. Sure, there are the technical masters such as Malmsteen and Vai, but no one has the same feel as Carlos Santana. It's just a shame that he would take all of his talent and throw it away on garbage like this.If you actually like this music, then have fun, jump off a bridge. But if you agree that Santana is better than this, than check out anything else, the earlier the better, and definately go live.Overall, this album makes me wannt to throw up. Santana replaces all the beautiful spanish sound and soulfull chord progressions with pop garbage. Don't buy it."
"I saw this when I was 12 years old and it freaked the shiznit out of me - low on gore, high on psychological thrils, MAGIC is an old-school horror flick of the classic kind - anchored by Anthony Hopkin's early bravura dual performance as Corky/Fats - but what I remember most about MAGIC isn't the movie, but the scary as hell TV spots that used to run back in the 70s on late-night TV - the bonus materials explain that after the simple, yet very creepy TV ads ran ONCE on TV in New York, they were pulled due to parental complaints about frightening their little tots - they're weren't far of the mark - as the camera pulls in and ""Fats"" intones his evil poem - ""Magic is fun...we're...DEAD!"" - you'll feel your blood turn to ice. A nice DVD to complete your horror collection - [...]"
"I loved this book when I was about eight years old, and looking back on it, it's easy to see why: William, the main character, is a gymnast (just as I was) who's rather shy and reserved (just as I was) but manages, when it's important, to help the people around him. He's immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid.Re-reading it recently, I found it didn't hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when I was younger (such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light), but it holds up better than many; this is a strong book for both children and for adults. I have a hard time imagining a more perfect book for bed-time reading."
This stuff was a waste of money. It contains Androst chemicals which are steroids. There are safer products on the market too. I tried Instinto Sensual. It is safe and works great too.
"I bought this video for the ""Conversation"" video where Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams Jr. are playing their guitars, singing, and sharing whisky. I like when they raise their whisky glasses to each other. This is a comical, well put together video with Robert Duvall. I like the 3 videos that tied together like a mini-movie... EVERY WALON JENNINGS FAN SHOULD OWN THIS GREAT VIDEO!..."
"It's actually a very poorly made and easily damaged costume. The purple color comes off in a strong breeze. Therefore it is very overpriced. Mine arrived with the fabric pre-ruined, but I don't have time or funds to make/buy another costume. You are much better off just buying a wig and putting the rest of the costume together yourself."
"Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused. Was it the same movie? The martial arts were ""ok"" in this, but nothing I havent seen done better before. The story-line was.. ummm. well, nevermind.Oh and did I mention the film doesnt end???? I mean I didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though.I really wantedto like this movie... but the only good thing I can say is that some of the sub-titles are hilarious!"
When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street.
"I have ordered 20 of 12 okamoto crown condoms, the total price for the comdoms is a little over 30 dollors, but they charge me overm 90 for the shipping!! It is much more expensive than the pirce I can buy in the retails stores! They charge the pircie as 20 different shippment but they ship me as one package (very light and small). I thought that was one order, but they charge me as 20 orders. I guess the shipment only cost them less than 10 dollors (grand shipping by post office), what a rib off!!"
"We bought this product as a gift for our friends to assist them in their 40th anniversary trip to Europe. In their return, one of the first things they said was ""how practical and how useful"" their GPS was in Europe, especially in England.Apparently, at practicality and ease of use departments it beat the in-dash product that came with their luxury automobile.Sounds like we picked the right product for the right purpose..."
"After two years of using component cables for my Xbox 360, and a year of using a Monster HDMI cable for my PS3, I decided that the difference in quality between the two was noticable enough for me to go out and buy another HDMI cable for my Xbox. After shopping around, and seeing the price and reviews for this cable, I bought it, and in all honesty, this cable is much worse than even my component cables. I tried a few different movies, and a few different games, all to no avail. Characters in my games are choppy, and pixelated, and all of the movies, even in HD quality are blurry. I decided to switch the two cables to see if it was just my Xbox, and immediately noticed the difference. This is a poor cable and I would not reccomend it to anyone who cares about the quality of the graphics on their screen."
"Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it. He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent. Flawed and fatalistic, cigarette between his fingers, he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another, in an effort to help a woman he doesn't even know. It's creepy and powerful. Angels, devils and friends. The guilty and innocent. Keanu Reeves is perfect in this role and it's a movie to watch again and again. Liked it a lot. Reminds me of Sandman Slim stories."
"My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded, but the route information itself is first class."
"Amazing, but the name is the most redeeming quality of this movie. The ""chain gang"" is comprised of MEN, and only men. Men escape from a chain gang with a little help from two women. Acting is okay to bad, quality is okay to bad, story is okay to bad."
Great movie. Well directed and true historic account of the life of the Queen. Great action and plot. Not like some of those cheap Chinese movies.
"This is a very good CD. There is no song on this CD that I don't like, even though the radio only plays one song."
"I have never received this item. It was first mis-delivered (not to me) and never arrived. Now, it has not been sent.As for the movie, I've seen it more than once. It's a great movie. Just wish I could get it delivered. Can you help me out?"
"Its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it.. then slowly it just hits you and you can't stop listening to it. Also this cd is sorta more insane (literaly) than the first one. and its abit more slow paced. Rocks. Get it! Also, this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too."
"I started the book when I was seven or so, and I almost couldn't put it down at night! Each chapter has gripping detail, enough violence to satesfy a kid my age, and the charecter's actions and feelings were so real-like that I felt like I was right there, at a Gathering, right there, at the fight between ThunderClan and ShadowClan, right there, in the ThunderClan camp. I'm ten now, have read the whole first series twice and have started the second series, and I'd recomend this book to any kid who likes cats, excitment, adventure, and a litle pinch of violence now and then in their books. The begining of the story of Rusty, the so-called kittypet, who joins a clan of feral cats and saves the day in the end, who came from Firepaw to Fireheart, the ThunderClan warrior!"
"I personally like this, but it dries too fast. I constantly need to reapply this after a few minutes. The feel of this is pretty nice, and the consistency is a little thick but overall I thought this was pretty good."
The company fixed the CD and sounds great now! Great company to work with. Very responsive. Would definitely buy from them again!Would definitely give them 5 stars but Amazons review editing system won't let me change my rating!
"I've long been a fan of Robert B. Parker Spenser books but, even though I watched them, I didn't really care much for the Robert Urich ""Spenser for Hire"" series. Too 'goody two-shoes' and 'television-ized.' That's why, when I found these Joe Mantegna movies, I enthusiastically thought that someone made some Spenser movies that were a little more 'raw' and true to the books. What a disappointment! The stories were accurate enough, but Joe Mantegna as Spenser? A former cop and boxer? I don't THINK so! I found him, and the actors filling the roles of Hawk and Susan to be completely unbelievable and wrong for the parts. These movies really made me MISS the Robert Urich series!"
I take the unit off the bike every time I stop(I don't trust the locking screw).One time I did not fully secure the GPS into the cradle.While going down the road at 50+ miles per hour it flew off.I thought great there's $600 down the drain.I circled back and picked up the device.It was banged up in a few places (the corners were completely scuffed).I turned it on and it WORKED!I have fully tested it and everything works (it's now 15+ days since the incident).All-in-all a good GPS for those of us who are a little rough on our hardware.
"This climbing block is excellent stablizer for frontwheel and gives it a balance. It also maintains height of front wheel. I never "" stacked "" more than one because I never ordered more because of expence. I did not use it for climbing, nor I had any difficulty climbing my bike. I suggest buying it with your cycleops unit."
"I would not recommend ""Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet"" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in 1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins, mankind's religions, mankind's future, etc. ======= If I were to only judge the insights that this book provides into the awesome technology and power exhibited by aliens, a well as the awesome influence that aliens can wield upon human beings, I would have to give the highest rating available (five stars). However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled ""The Sacred And The Profane"", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message."
"Clay's voice soars to new territory on this CD, particularly on songs like ""Touch"" and ""Run to Me"" and ""Invisible"", which could otherwise be categorized as ho-hum pop music, if Clay wasn't singing them. The lyrics are a little corny, but Clay makes them sound sincere. The vocal range of most of these songs is not very great, and thus they don't properly show off Clay's unique tenor to-die-for voice.I wish that the ""experts"" who molded some of these songs would have kept their involvement in the project to a minimum, and left the songs pure, instead of processing them with pop synthesizer sounds. I can hear that on any modern day pop album, and it is not very special. On the other hand, I can only hear Clay's voice on a few CD's. And his true voice is great enough that it shouldn't be crowded by synthesizer warble."
"The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores."
"This is a good come-back from the 'This Aint A Game' album, that album was good wit songs like 'wait a minute', 'where do we go from here', 'wet me' and 'formal invite',etc. However, this album is even better. You can tell that he has grown up on this album. I think he is making a name for himself in the music business, and wont just be known as Brandy's kid brother. My fav tracks on this album are: 'Exotic' - love this song 2 bits cant get enough of it. 'In tha Mood', 'Anytime', 'One Wish', 'What I Need' and the crunk track 'Keep Sweatin'. However, there are a few dodgy tracks on there like 'Quit Actin' - i was excited when i saw R. Kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it. 'The War Is Over' - i liked the last duet they did 'another day in paradise' bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then. However, overall its a good album ... WELL DONE RAY J."
"It's quite a while since I saw this movie, but it made a big impact on me at the time. I particularly liked Kubrick's use of classical music. I am keen to purchase a VHS copy but it would have to be in the PAL format - suitable for Australia"
"This is one of my favorite shows. I have contacted Sony for a release date, but I can't seem to get a difinitive answer. This has been out for almost 2 years. Please post a response if anyone knows what to do or who to contact to request the other seasons be released. I'll sign a petition if that will help!!!L.W."
"pro's :great fun, portable.con's: hard to read LED except in darkness ,no off button.As soon as I got this toy I started playing it.but then ,I found out that in bright light I could not see the LED so I went in some shade.Now thats just fine except theres no shade indoors!so I found a dull light and used it.But then I brushed the yesbutton and no button would turn it off so I had to play it though.But overall if you have a dull reading light and you are patient, buy this product."
This book is very well written and researched. It is obvious that the negative reviewers on this site are the radical religious extremists that it is written about.
"Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie, but it wasn't as funny or had as good of acting as the others. This movie is good to watch a couple of times, but only a couple times. If you have extra cash though, I say get it. You won't regret it."
"I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn't like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic."
"Wow, what a great book about a dystopian society, censorship, and the need of the state to keep the masses blind, deaf, and dumb. If you enjoyed ""1984"", ""Brave New World"", or ""The Giver"", you must read this. It is now one of my favorites!"
"I really enjoy this movie, I haven't read the book, but the storyline in the movie is excellent. I would buy this on blu-ray in a heartbeat if it were to become available. My only fault with the movie is that (in my opinion) the ""overdubbed voice-overs"" (not sure exactly what you call them) toward the end seem a little overbearing."
I read this entire book from front to back in 1 day. IT WAS GREAT. Full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not
"I bought this piece of crap and found out it's not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM (Digital Rights Management) format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in. So, I have basically a $200 radio. Worthless. DO NOT BUY!!!"
"I have always been intriqued with guys like Thanos, Apocalypse, Galactus and so on. These is a great story about the mad power hungry thanos and the super heroes who have to stop him. I learn alot of things I did not know of Thanos. I have yet to finish reading the book, I am halfway there but I have to say I have loved it. I am not that big of a comics collector but I decided to buy this and I must say its a great read."
"Whoa boy, I've seen some pretty lame flicks last year, but The Skulls definitely comes in as one of the worst. It's a mind-bogglingly stupid tale about a pretty boy (Joshua Jackson) who stupidly decides to join a secret society, and it seems all the members of this society, called The Skulls, are pretty dumb in their own rights, too. Of course, this didn't prepare me for the lame as heck finale, which features a duel, that's right, a duel involving two flintlock pistols."
Very good sequel. Moderate amount of action & an actual plot unlike many new movies. If you own the first this is a definite addition to your video home library
"Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome, so has a good seal to it."
"This book was written in 1987! Technically speaking, it's completely out of date.My major criticism, though, is the low value of the content. Do we really need to be taught that soft or pastel colors appeal more to women? Not only is that kind of thinking outdated, but who needs to read a book with that level of ""information""?"
That a bad star for clay aiken this c-d is really borring and all the songs sound the same. One listen of this album is enought to say don't waste your money into this c-d. Really peace of nothing.
"THIS BOOK HAD GREAT CHARACTERS AND PLOT. IT TOOK PLACE IN PARIS,FRANCE. IT IS ABOUT A FAMILY WITHOUT A HOME. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IS ARMAND, THE TRAMP.THE ILLUSTRATIONS REALLY ADDED TO THE STORY. I CAN SEE WHY IT WON A NEWBERRY MEDAL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE."
"Having written fiction since I was 7 (that's 80 years ago), I am impressed by what this young man has achieved. It's not great literature, nor even particularly original, but it's an excellent start. I couldn't have done as well at his age; and I'm a dam' good writer."
"For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns, I recommend The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy."
"I had to read this book for literiture class I hated it. my teacher rattled on about the symbolizm in this book.It was so boring and kinda gory.Plus no girls, wasnt they susposed to repopulate the world after nuclear war so not possible wih only boys. The one thing i found interesting was how they acted like wild animals after they had been on the island a while.that was kinda cool.But it was to confusing"
"A fun CD from beginning to end. Starts out with the radio hit ""Zoot Suit Riot"", a very catchy tune with plenty of brasswork that doesn't sound too serious or too contrived. The lyrics reflect the swing-era roots but contain modern phrases and topics (some a little risque). Very tight execution of the genre, every song has a little hook or element that is straight from the swing era. The lyrics are clever and descriptive with a lot of detail. A good CD for either serious headphone listening or to just put on in the background."
"Loosely based upon Isaac Asimov's story, Will Smith's I, Robot is good. I rarely have anything good to say about such adaptations but this detective story set in a future in which robots are commonplace is well-done and gripping. Although I think the key plotline of following ""breadcrumbs,"" or deliberately set clues, could have been done better the special effects are for the most part impressive and believable. The acting was good and I was pleased to watch it."
I saw the Heart of Gold concert from the Ryman Aud. on Showtime recently and found the music and staging superb.Neil sounded great and his asides between numbers showed how sensitive a performer he really is to those in his audience. I immediately ordered the Prarie Winds CD as well as the DVD. However I was disappointed that Four Strong Winds was not included on the CD. This is a beautiful song by Ian Tyson also found on CASH -V by Johnny Cash. I would hope that Neil's version will eventually make it to a CD in the future. I recommend both to all Neil's fans.
This is even more brain-dead than the average rap CD. She's certainly pretty enough; why can't she hire someone to write her some decent songs to sing? Or one even.
The plastic hinge mount on the cover that I bought to replace the broken plastic hinge mount on the cover that came with my Ique M5 has now broken. I will now buy another and try to reinforce the hinge before it breaks again.Garmin 010-10567-07 Leather Flip Cover for iQue M5
Works great now I get the best steamed veggies the company sent it fast I give the company and the steamer 5 star
"Who said that this movie was based on historycal facts ?? : So what's all the BS from the over reviewers about a gladitor woould never do this or that ; an emperor blablablablabla...... If you want history go to the library and get a book ! If you want great action, great settings, beautiful pictures and exceptional acting then get this movie !!!!!!!!!! Crowe & Phoenix are great, the story is full of action, suspense, love, etc... Great movie"
"When I rented this movie, from a friend's suggestion (he said he liked it in the seventh grade so at 26, I should like it too) I dind't really know what I was going to get. Little did I know I was going to get Charlie from the Mighty Ducks. While he's not the lovable winner from the show about ice hockey, he's still the good guy and good guys win (SPOILER ALERT)."
"What a waste of paper and time! There is much talk of how Eisenberg has hit ""the sweet spot"" with this book -- bah! Humbug! Sweet nothings is more like it. Entertainingly and personably written, it's as informative as a Jerry Seinfeld tv skit about finances. Eisenberg writes extremely well, but it's all much ado about nothing. Read the last two short chapters at the bookstore and put the money you save into your 401K."
"Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand."
I first read this book at a young age. I enjoyed it very greatly then. Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages.
I think this is a great book for anyone who might suspect they have endo or was just diagnosed with it. It was a great read lots of info!
It was great to read this classic once again. Read it years ago and forgot how great especially around the holidays
"Some have called this book a ""basic guide"" for the Enron mess. I would call it a basic guide for falling asleep. I worked at Enron, and there is nothing more annoying than self-proclaimed experts trying to explain the ins-and-outs of a company from the outside. It's about as accurate and useful as a binder-ful of news clippings. This book fails to capture the spirit of Enron, and fails to capture the essence of what really went wrong. I hope some better books come along, because the quick-and-dirty paperback version here was a waste of time and money."
"A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core, which meant that I needed a smaller size. I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso. Other then that this is great buy."
"Cut the crap! it's motorhead, it's rock n' roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i'll be your sister, metropolis."
"I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD. Ray Bradbury reads it, and it is very bad. It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off. He reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep. Someone needs to re-make the CD's."
The watch is in perfect condition but cannot set the time and it keeps going dead. I thought it was a new watch but acts like a used watch. I wont order from this vendow again.
This is just a copy of the movie. It is not an original. The DVD was burned on a DVD-R. The labels are nice but the DVD does not contain any menu features at all.
"The Bonfire of the Vanities clearly made several strong points about racism, sexism and capitalism in America, but I personally enjoyed the attention Wolfe paid to developing the characters and situations each character was in. All the plot lines are just built up by the indepth description of how each character was involved. The reader is never left wondering why the characters are doing what they are doing, but everything is very obviously connected by Wolfe's previous narrative that it gives the reader something to look to for clarification. Specific events such as the mayors obsession with mayonnaise ""who in the name of God would bring a half eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public meeting?"" or Sherman's confusion in the Bronx ""Who on Earth would take the trouble to shove a chair in a chicken wire fence in this neighborhood?"" also shows the actual character's detail orientedness, and perhaps shows that focus on detail is an inherent human flaw."
Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
"Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did."
"This book was a great follow up to David Moody's first book in his Autumn series. The virus that has taken over the world has hit The City - plenty of new characters and twists and turns. Even though most zombie books are predictable, David Moody gives an exciting and new experience for zombie lovers. You almost feel like you are there... This book is hard to put down - when you get to the last 20 pages, you just want it to go on, and on, and on... Shame that David's Autumn series is not able to be purchased at book stores in Australia though, which means you have to pay a LOT OF MONEY for one book - BUT the books are Totally Worth It!!!! I LOVE the Autumn series, and cannot wait to purchase the next books in his Autumn series!"
"I was an English Lit. major, and never a big fan of Dickens. He is too long winded. But this book seemed too short. It's not that I felt that it was incomplete. I just enjoyed it so much that I wanted more.Do yourself a favor, and read it at christmas time. I did."
We watched this again after many years. It is still just as funny! Kevin Bacon is great. I love Reba in it too.
"The first song I heard on this album was ""Bounce,"" and to be quite honest, I wasn't impressed. But I saw the CD at Best Buy, and thought, ""Why not."" I must say it has not been something I've regretted. This is nu-metal years ahead of any other band you will find out there, with insightful underlying political protest all the way through. But if you want an album to just rock out to... well this is actually an amazing choice anyway. There is some amazing stuff here. Like ""Chop Suey!"" a deeply touching/disturbing song about the unpleasant topic of suicide and ""Toxicity"" a song about the terrible disorder in the world. With the split of Rage Against the Machine, there is little possible competition for System on their way to the nu-metal top."
"My Grandmother bought this for me when I was 2 years old. I've loved since then. I havent watched it in a while so I decided to watch it one day when nothing was interesting on T.V. This movie bought back so many memories of when me, my cousins (who I havent spoken to since i was 8) and friends were little. I knew every song and every line. Get this movie. It's a classic and a good movie for adults as well as kids. You wont regret buying this."
"I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns, Should You?by the same author. That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive ""pamphlet"" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere."
I bought the nailer over a year ago and use it every few weeks when I get some finish work. It is light weight and it is easy to clear jams. One day it would not fire. I took it to be rebuilt and had an estimate of $100. The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $189. So I am ordering the Hitachi today.
"The problem with old (esp. foreign) film is that it can be hard to find good editions. Classics like this, which have already survived the test of time, tend to get picked up by two-bit distributors and released in the most disgraceful of manners. Thank god for the Criterion Collection; This lavish transfer will not disappoint those with a healthy aesthetic. Reading a lot of the other reviews, I've noticed that they've mentioned something about the sound quality: it's true, even in the newly restored edition there are some imperfections, but I don't think that is enough to merit less than 5 stars (maybe 4.5, but that's not an option.)"
"Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote ""alternative"" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger."
"For anyone looking for an introduction to math, geometry more specifically, or philosophy at large, this is THE book, and in my estimation, THE edition to get. Heath is no fly-by-night pop-philosopher. His notes are almost as worthwhile as the text itself... a truly monumental feat.The rigors of geometry, the method of logic learned in these proofs, are one of the best ways to prepare the mind for real philosophy. Anyone can talk about the true and the good in a manner that inspires awe through vagueness and transcendent language, but that is a very different matter than the sort of philosophy that is built upon the real work of logic and hard-earned definitions.If you have any interest in the latter, I heartily commend this book to you."
"Having recently watched a ""Made for TV"" movie based on the true events contained in this book I was anxious to read the facts about the way the good folk of Gander, Newfoundland rallied round & accomodated, fed & entertained an influx of 6,600 air travellers aboard 39 planes which had been diverted to their town due to American airspace being shut down on 9/11.I was not disappointed !Jim Defede, the writer, presents a very well written account of the 4 days that the world came to Gander & chronicals both the huge logistical operation and the emotional experiences for both passengers and townsfolk.Many friendships were formed over those 4 days which exist to the present day, and I cannott commend the town of Gander enough for the humble, caring way they held out the hand of genuine friendship to complete strangers.This is a "" must read"" book."
Someone could tell about italian language on ultimate edition ?Thanks for helpHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]
Love these practice swords I have purchased some before and my son just plain wore them out. These are for Christmas and I already know he will love them...
"""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris was so good--even better for its black and white medium, which enhances the sense of the macabre and general off-kilterness of the set. Why don't they remake ""The Wizard Of Oz?"" Now, there's a picture that could be made MUCH pertier with modern cinematography. The cheap set and old theatre-style acting throw a damper on what's still is a great universal story."
"The dryer worked fine but I only use a hair dryer occasionally so I'd only used it twice in 6 weeks. When I went to use it the third time, it was deader than a doornail. No power. I guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it. Too late to return it. I've seen other reviews with a similar problem so it seems they have some quality control issues to work out and if you buy one, it's the luck of the draw if you get a 'good' one or not. I'm generally very pleased with my purchases through Amazon...but this one was a dud."
"Okay, if you're a special effects freak, you might like this. However, there are much better films with equally good effects. If you're a fan of minor things like say, oh... plot, character development, etc., then stay away! The 1963 Robert Wise film is the scariest film I've ever seen, and the scares come from what Wise DOESN'T show you. The '63 version was brilliantly plotted and paced, with one of the greatest ending lines in film history. The 1999 version has none of this. Do yourself a favor, and see the '63 movie, or better yet, read the Shirley Jackson novel. The only reason this gets one star is because C. Zeta-Jones is just SO easy on the eyes!"
"I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software..."
"This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However, there were lots of bedroom scenes. Leading character was very immoral and there was language. In the end, the son winds up euthanizing his father after the encouragement of his wife. Very dissapointed"
"If you are thinking of purchasing this bible, spend the extra money and purchase the larger book. This one is a nice personal size but the print is so small it is hard to read. I bought it for my granddaughter who told me it hurt her eyes to read it."
"The lovely watercolor print shows a pond skating scene, full of Holly Pond Hill bunnies in their victorian costumes. Very sweet! There is a little flap to open for each day of the advent season with a cute little surprise inside.It will stand upright on a table or under your tree. It can be stored for use in years to come.I'm looking forward to starting an advent calendar tradition with my toddler this year. She'll really enjoy those cute bunnies."
"Just finished and I could go back and read it again. Ms. Gregory truly 'gets' the era, history and nuances of court life and brings to life how it affects each character."
"This is a very interesting movie, considering that now the term ""gaslight"" is being used to describe a form of abuse. I had never known what it was until a friend mentioned it a while back and then another friend recently mentioned this movie. I was delighted to watch it here on Amazon and do love the old black and white movies. The setting is so wonderfully done & the acting is marvelous. This is overall a good movie to watch, regardless of the form of abuse and message being sent across."
Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
"This is in my top 5 best books of all time. I give it an A+. It is a very long read that covers a broad range of information involving economics, but well worth the time spent. There are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during Smith's time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader, but can still be applied to modern times. I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as ""extremely pernicious"". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future."
"I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter)."
Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
"I have not heard this album, but for those of you who remember the ORIGINAL Priss from the BubbleGum Crisis, Hurricane should be on here! if not than it is not her best!"
"This film bears only a passing resemblance to Rosamund Pilcher's THE SHELL SEEKERS. The director watered down the book's powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters. Angela Lansbury does her best but cannot help the tepid writing. The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast. I expected a better film from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end. Don't buy it. In fact, it's hardly worth renting. Reread the book instead."
"This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased. I would love to have my money back. What was John Grisham thinking about, when he wrote this? Obviously, he wasn't thinking. I have read everyone of his books, and if the rest of them are going to be like this, I will have to pass. I am an avid reader of John's; I am the one that can't wait until his next book comes out. I will have to wait next time, because I won't ever read another one like this!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this. This film was not at all faithful to the book. The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg. In the movie, the spot is way over on his back! In the book, Shiloh's tail was a couple inches long. In the movie, it's like a foot!The classic ""this little piggy goes to market"" scene has been ommitted, and scene where Shiloh tries to hump the kid's leg was just plain unneccesary. C'mon, this is supposed to be a family movie! Avoid this and read the fantastic book trilogy instead(which I also wrote a comprehensive review for)"
can any body please tell me who made the music for the soundtrack?i want to know please tell me.thanx
These replacement blades worked great when I needed to repair my AlienFly after flying it into the wall too many times!
This book was suggested to me by a counselor I was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction. We both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction. There is so much information in this book and I would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation.
"this was a random movie I picked out on Netflix to watch and I am so glad I did. I laughed, I cried, I know it sounds cliche, but what an amazing love story. Such a great message."
"I'd used this adapter with my Canon SX30IS to place polaraized, coloraized and neutral filter of 58mm, 'cause I like big filters better. I'd to zoom a little to get rid of the black corner, but is perfect after that."
"Don't believe all the five star reviews this release has received, many of those are for the film itself and were entered in before the blu ray was even released.As others have said, the picture on this blu ray is pathetic, DNR and EE everywhere, I'm no A/V fanatic but even I can tell when a blu ray looks like crap, especially this one. If you love the movie just buy the DVD version and watch it up-scaled on your blu ray player, it'll save you some serious money and frustration."
"Reviewer: Renee S. NYC. August 13, 2008The plot is typical Noir, the hero typical world-weary and disillusioned Hammett orChandler, but the atmosphere is stunning!It was a whole new world for me and I fellcompletely into it from Vinnie's first nightmare to the final dripping conclusion.Mr. Moore's descriptions of Thailand andthe Thai people are evocative and real. Onecan feel the heat and humidity, see the swirlsand flashes of colors, and almost touch the waves of misery that radiate offthe pages. And the story's not bad either. I was interested in all the little tidbitsabout life in Bangkok - and the story's not bad either. There were a confusing numberof characters, some of whom did not advance the plot at all, and the plotting could have been tighter, but all-in-all I would definitely recommend the book. Just be sure you read it in an air-conditioned space, because otherwise you will surely melt from its heat!"
I watch this movie over and over. I've watched since I was a little girl and I still love it to this day. It's a very addicting movie.
I have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad. Two major problems with this router:1. Wireless range is BAD (I own a cheap router and it has twice the range)2. Router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple PC's are accessing the internet at once.I have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but doesn't. Hopefully they will come out with a new version soon!
"IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSE ANOTHER PERSON'S OPINION BUT I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE. I READ ABOUT 100 PAGES AND TOSSED IT. THE WRITING IS VERY STILTED AND ITS JUST NOT A COMFORTABLE READ. HEROINE AGGIE IS SO FULL OF START THAT SHE'S JUST NO LIKEABLE, EVEN IN THE LOVE SCENES....."
"I have been addicted to this real life story for over 25 years. I've starred as Mother Gilbreth on stage and also directed the production. I will be directing it again because it has everything audiences want...humor, honesty,character development and bittersweet reality. It's a family show that focuses on parenting and family unity. I'll be staging it at The Barn Theatre in Stuart Sept 24th - Oct 10th. Auditions are August 8th, 9th and 10th at 7pm at The Barn Theatre, 2400 E. Ocean Blvd., Stuart."
"We lost the handset. Called Panasonic to get a replacement, they would not sell us a replacement handset. Overall disappointed with Panasonic and this phone."
"Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night, the new transfer is quite frankly awful."
"This Honeywell product is excellent. It works quietly and easily circulates air while providing the desired breeze.I believe the unit will outlive its generous warranty, and would not hesitate to purchase another one if and when it should wear out."
"Of all the albums we bought in the 70s this is one of my favorites! When I get in the mood for reggae I usually start here with 'Let my days be long' (or 'Revolution' on Marley's 'Natty Dread'). It is 'religious', as others have mentioned, but that shouldn't be a problem if you appreciate different styles(?) of reggae. Did I forget to mention 'Super Ape' or Augustus Pablo? Man."
"When I purchased this book, I hoped that it would help me improve my SAT score. It has helped my improve my score, but lacked some of the tricks that I had expected to find in it. This book offers a great amount of practice problems and excellent explanations, but it gives very little information about some of the test taking tips that other books give. So, if you're looking for a book that gives you a lot of practice with verbal problems, this books is excellent. However, if you hope to find tricks of the trade in this book, look somewhere else because this book gives very minimal."
"Maybe it's because I've been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial/EBM for the past few years. Or perhaps it's just Prodigy did not put enough effort into this release. Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this single...Baby's Got A Temper just does not catch the attention of my ears. In ways it does mimic the style of a few of Prodigy's past songs with the break beats and repeating synth lines, but it just can't match the magic of their former hits like Breathe and Firestarter. The remixes of Baby's Got A Temper are not really that much to look forward to on this single either. Even die-hard Prodigy fans should find somewhere to listen to this single first before buying it. Hopefully Prodigy's upcoming album will incorporate some more inspired songs for redemption from this lackluster single."
"Checked with Sears and they could no longer help. I had one remote that I had to hold just right to get it to work.I ordered two of these remotes. The compatibility match is perfect. These are exactly as described. It took me longer to get the ladder out, to reach the green button on the back of the garage door opener unit, then it did to set the frequency on the two I ordered. Took approximately 15 or 20 seconds to set the frequency on both remotes. Extremely easy. Perfect match, perfect replacement. Wish I had ordered sooner."
My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young. Actually I have one of the first publications of it. I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again. So happy to have it on my Kindle now.
Loved the connection not only with history and the Bible but also with Lynn's interpretation of the characters. Made me want to seek out the Word in the Kings and Chronicles. Anything that leads us to the Lord has to be great.
The quality of the case is poor. It does not close well. And there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case. Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow?
"The text of this book is some eighty pages, which appear to be a very bare-bones summary of various theories of learning, often with charts inserted from other books, with very few examples or guidelines as to how one would actually implement any of those ideas. You really just get an academic summary of these ideas with virtually no context or elaboration. I would recommend you rather go directly to the work of the Israeli educationalist Feuerstein (see the book by Sharron and Coulter, Changing Children's Minds), and that of Stanley Greenspan (numerous books), which seem to be the key works reflected in this all-too-brief book"
Not too much to say about this adapter. It does what it's supposed to. Sure an N adapter would be better but even the G is over priced.
"I bought this more for fashion than function, but it has both. It is a very comfortable shoe, and very durable. It is also really nice looking."
"I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn't, mis-spellings of stillsuit as ""stulsuit""....Please, buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you'd think with it being on the computer it'd be easier to check for errors. Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune."
"I don't really expect a lot from Voyager novels. Fact is, I rarely buy them unless they're part of a series like this one. So, I found myself pleasantly surprised by this one. Carey doesn't rely as much on the bar to jar the reader in and out of the story and it's stronger for that. She gives Janeway her own unique voice and makes reading the book a pure pleasure. My only gripe is that Carey's love of sailing shows through far too many times and is getting a bit tedious since it's been the focus of her past several Trek yarns. But otherwise, an enjoyably pleasant book."
NICE CASE. GOOD QUALITY. PHONE FIT A BIT SNUG TO START BUT LOOSENING UPAND FITTING BETTER WITH TIME.
According to the manufacturer this toy is for 6 YEARS and up! Fun for OLDER kids!
"One of the worst books I have ever read. Ever! I forced myself to read it only because it was a gift, but honestly it's not worth the paper it was printed on. I wish I had those hours of my life back, I totally regret reading it.The characters are flat and have only one demension. The names are either copied from better books, impossible to pronounce or complete cheese. Through out the whole book you feel bad for the characters because the dialog is so bad.I've read better work by 14 year old class mates!"
The diapers were fine except my order was for 124 diapers and I only received 112. I also didn't have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete.
"Almost as good as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but more of a kid's story.Very enjoyable even so"
Yet another awesome season of Weeds. A must have it you have the other 3 seasons.
"I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying. Tobey Maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle. His snivelling self-conflicted, let-me-show-you-my-feminine-side routine was a bit overplayed. For a minute I thought that it was the exact character that he played in Cider House. Somehow I couldn't help imagining Roger Ebert with a toothy grin, ramming popcorn in his mush while fawning over Maguire's touching portrayal of a superhero in conflict. Seriously, this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved. A few reviews ago somebody mentioned ""not seeing enough of maquire's body."" Was that a joke? After seeing him in this film I am ready to concede that there is a place for steroid use in this world. Reading these reviews I'm suspecting that the production company is paying people to write reviews on amazon."
"The authors have taken the opportunity to publish a book of which they wrote only a small portion. The plot progresses through the snippets of first-time writers. This book is not a part of the series but an attempt to milk the series for all it's worth. (See also Grantville Gazette I,II, III).Instead of a cogent style, the book is pieced together from snippets available elsewhere. As a result the book fails to tell a cogent story, forcing the reader to parse disparate language and editorial differences from section to section."
"At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that ""Brave New World"" book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time."
I have used a Dazey and it worked great. The Mr Coffee keeps it a little warm but I like my coffee hot.
"When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all."
Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.
"I really like this cooker. Somewhat different than expected but after using it, I am sold. Nice size."
"he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him, ruben and pharrell do a joint together anyway clay's an okay singer but ruben was better too bad they got rid of frenchie davis to quote funkadelic the girl is bad."
"I saw this film because I was such a fan of the orignal version. What a dissapointment. This film goes heavy on the gross-out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes. The original was much scarier because of what you didn't see. The imagination is a powerful tool. We can imagine much worse that what we see. Just knowing the blob was somewhere, without actually seeing too much of it provided me with years of nightmares. I own the DVD of the original and watch it at least six or seven times a year. Matt Dillon was the flavor of the month when the remake came out. His performance was less than remarkable. An earlier review mentioned that Dillon was a much better choice of teen angst/rebellion than was Steve McQueen. Interesting, where the hell has Dillon been since this abortion of a film? McQueen is an icon and is still much more popular than Dillon. McQueen is also dead."
"Although Chekov's play accurately reflects the decline of Aristocratic power in 19th century Russia, it is unfulfilling. Mdm. Ranevskaya's Orchard is bought under her feet by a ""friend"" whose hunger for profit motivated his friendship with her. So this is the transformative moment: Mdm. Ranevskaya loses her most cherished possession, and then what? Her friend, Lopahin, feins innocense, Mdm. Ranevskaya runs off to Paris to whom or what? We never find out. It's sort of like biting into a pretty good apple only to have it fall on the ground."
"First of all, this book isn't 344 pages as listed. It is only 156. Secondly, this book only consists of english words and their chinese equivalents in simplified character form. NO pinyin and NO example sentences. This book would only be useful to Chinese people who want to translate english words directly into Chinese. This book is advertised as both english-chinese and chinese-english, however there is no chinese-english. I ordered this book before it was released and just received it. I am extremely disappointed. I repeat: NO Pinyin and NO example sentences."
"R. Kelly is still on top! TP-2.com consists of 19 blazin tracks, some of my favorite tracks are Fiesta, Just Like A Real Freak, I Wish, I Wish (remix), Strip For You, Greatest Sex, Feelin on Yo Booty, I Mean, I Don't Mean it, All I Want, Just Like That The Storm is Over Now, this track is no doubt the best song on the album, this song is tight! and many other tracks are good too. If don't have this album, get out there and get it. If you don't like slow R&B don't get this but if u do I would recommend this for you. I saw R. Kelly in concert and he is awesome, he keeps droppin those platinum hits for his fans. Get this album right now! ... peace"
"We have tried several brands of diapers and definitely prefer Pampers for our son. They fit him best and we very rarely have ""explosions."" This box is a great value."
Where to start? This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama. The plot is so predictable it is sickening. This movie wasn't even released until after Harry Potter was released.
"This books has loads of information, but it is in black and white and the fonts make it difficult to hold one's attention. I would not purchase this again."
"I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous. To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised."
"I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story, so I'll just comment on this particular edition of Little Women. I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection."
"I made the mistake of buying this album having not heard any of the songs, and only being a faithful fan of Kiss. Yeah I think that new fans (people that started to listen to Kiss after the reunion) might enjoy this. It has all of the elements of classic Kiss, but it's missing something.Do I think that the prime motivation for this was the money?Yes. Purely for cash. It's nice that the fans had something to go with the tour that was happening at the time, but this album doesn't age very well, mainly because this album wasn't very good in it's conception, and was executed poorly.In retrospect, Kiss has made worse albums. ""Unmasked"" comes to mind. Peter Criss' solo album was weak, but at least an effort was made. ""Animalize"" was poor, but Kiss was playing catch-up, and was breaking in a new guitarist too.Some of the tunes are catchy enough, but that wears off quickly. Based on the merit of the somewhat catchy songs, I rated this 2 stars. Other than that, not much here."
"This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim's parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book. The ""mystery"" though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn't have murdered him on the spot. And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim's true nature. There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward. Exasperating and annoying."
"This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year (right there with ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and ""Cruel Intentions""). The plot is predictable, the actors worthless (or maybe the plot just wasn't any good), and there's really no good reason to watch it. See, if this movie were at least rated R and they actually showed some T&A instead of just hinting at it, maybe there'd be a reason to watch this movie, what with all the hotties in it. However, bad dialogue, combined with predictable plot, bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie. What a waste of my time!"
"A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read."
"Getting the book, I thought it 'would change my life' through all the insight Sennett would bestow on me. Sadly not the case, it was a lackluster title. I don't really have any suggestions as to what might be better."
"This movie could have been great. Russell Crowe is, despite the not so well written screenplay and mediocre plot, very convincing in his role, in fact he is the only one who makes a pretty good job in this movie - Phoenix was not bad. But that just because Russell Crowe in an excellent actor. The movie fails because it was bad told, and not well directed. You couldn't identify nor share the characters feelings because of the large distance there seemed to be between them and the audience, and that's where the director fails, in the telling of the story."
This dvd set is to complete my existing collection. It is one of the most enjoyable shows that I have ever watched! I recommend it to everyone.
"I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY USEFUL Being a practicing Christan and not being into WICCA or Witchcraft I have never had the occassion to purchase a book on candle burning before now. I had always associated such practices and being associated with Satan worship. Boy was I dead wrong. The author says that candle burning is a positive force in the universe...and not at all negative like I had thought. I got out my Bible and did one or two of the candle burning spells and found that the room was immediately energized with white light all around. I felt very peaceful . . . I had wanted to help someone in my family overcome a bad situation in their life (its somewhat of a personal matter so I wont go into it here), and a few days later I received a phone call from the family member and it turned out what I had prayed for using this book came about.I have given this book to others to use and they also report very positive benefits so I would recommend it to anyone who asked."
"Barry Corbin ends up with a Korean family that he never knew he had. He is gruff and not accepting of his visitors, not even friendly, but soon mellows during the Christmas season. The usual characters are here - a wonderful series that should have lasted longer. This chapter is just another example of great acting and terrific writing. I enjoyed the old VHS and it arrived in perfect shape. Wonderful, family entertainment."
"Parricia Corwell, Cruel & Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning! Her relation to her family, her dedication to her work exeptional. However, this story began to get boring towards the end...the ending, not too great."
This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.
"Excellent book. Does not assume any musical training, explains everything starting with the music notation. The exercises are truly gradual: each introduces only a few new hand positions, and future exercises reinforce hand positions introduced earlier. The early exercises are simple yet sound reasonably well not to be hopelessly boring, and one can hear when one plays them incorrectly. Great book for self-study. It was recommended to me independently by two very good classical guitar players; and my technique and sight-reading skills have improved notably since starting to use this book."
"This is Cyrano de Bergerac updated and told with the craziness of Steve Martin's brain--a wonderful, funny movie. Martin is the fire chief of a scenic Northwest resort town. There are two newcomers to town: a professional firefighter (Rick Rossovich) and a beautiful female astronomer (Daryl Hannah). Martin, the self-assured, passionate but ugly (that schnoz) chief and Rossovich, the dumb but handsome hunk both fall for Hannah; of course Hannah is interested in the hunk. But Rossovich is unable to talk to bright women, so Martin feeds him lines and Hannah is swept off her feet. The mistaken identity is all worked out satisfactorily by picture's end (Martin wins Hannah). Everything works perfectly in this movie, and Martin is at his very best. I've watched this quite a few times over the years and the humor never gets stale. A terrific movie."
"I absolutely love Tom Grants music and this record (the view from here) is a fantastic album...infact one of his best! I have seen Tom Grant live many times and he is an amazing performer and puts on an amazing live show..For anyone who buys this CD you will not be disappointed...It is truely a great cd and Tom Grant is one of the all smooth jazz greats!Regards,J.Fitzgerald"
"I was looking forward to receiving this book, as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine's restaurant. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund."
"my second yamaha A/V reciever my first was A 2nd from top rxv-2090 it came out on the fringe of home theatre it had a excelent amp but a little out of date as far as home theatredecoding beeing its based on 5 channels not 5.1knowing i needed a updated after hearing my girl friends get this! 300$ home theatre in a box i realized while my 2090 sounded better the timming was better on her cheep system . Still I am surprised at how much better the HTR-5590 sounded my first dolbly digital movie blew my mind don't forget i had a 1500$ 1995 model yamaha witch was very good too ,i would give it a 4.5 but no option for it here"
"I expected a work on stalking to be very dry and difficult to get through. This book,however, was extremely interesting,informative and easy to read. It is the sort of book that the normal man in the street could read and apply as easily as someone who is more knowledgeable about the subject. A wonderful handbook for anyone having troubles of this nature and a wothwhile read for any safety conscious individual.."
"Unfortunatelly the DVD is dissapointing for Tina's fans. The show is fantastic, but both Dolby Digital and DTS version of this DVD have one of the worst sounds I ever heard. My subwoofer didn't move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames. More, the soundtrack was re-edited with sound taken from other concerts (that's incredible - at one moment I swear that I heard the word Munchen despite the fact that the concert is in Amsterdam). And, oh yes, the DVD is overpriced. Forget ""Amsterdam"" and don't miss ""One Last Time in Concert"" as it has verry good sound quality and image. Not speaking abut the phantastic show..."
"I recently replaced my 14 year old Velodyne FSR-12 with the DD-15. I did so because the FSR-12 was struggling in our new house with larger great room, and because the DD-15 was on sale due to its being replaced soon by the DD-15 Plus (at considerably higher price).The DD-15 is cruising in our new house. It really provides the bottom end that my Klipsch Heresies cannot. And it does not run out of steam at high volume, like the FSR-12 did.I am mainly a music guy, not so much into home theatre. The DD-15 brings music to life and makes the singers and instruments seem to be in the room with you. Everything you need is included, and the calibration software is a snap to use. The cabinetry is first rate. I got the cherry finish, and although I can't tell if it is really cherry; I would not bet money against it. It looks that good.I am quite pleased with Velodyne as a company, and I love my DD-15."
"i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have ""joan of arc"" the savior of the republic of france, to make her into a total lunatic? i know she had a minor case of epilepsy but she's not no EMILY ROSE. (in case you dont know emily rose she was a girl who was a epileptic that was so intence she was supposely possessed by demons.) how can u do such a thing? they made joan so annoying i didnt want to watch it no more. the action was not good at all. u could tell some of the cast of the movie were atheists because they made it look like those signs were not real. those signs were left by GOD and they were not by coincedence. dont bother pick it up and if you do, i doubt u will watch it again. this is the miami reviewer. PEACE."
Get characters. All kinds of emotional confrontations. Some things would be politically incorrect now. Loved it. Nice break from some of the thrown together single topic stories I've read recently.
"This is one of the sweetest, sad, funny, and actually profound Christmas specials ever. Well, maybe not Dostoyevsky deepness, but there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. The suits at CBS hated this series. They thought it was too intelligent for kids, and they didn't like Vince Guardaldi's jazz score (which is a bonafide classic now). It almost didn't air. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it."
"there it was, 1991. i heard black metalic for the fist time and i melted into the soundscape that is the catherine wheel. cruising in a car wasn't good enough for the record because the mellower moments couldn't be audible with out blowing your ear drums on the loud parts. god bless this band, they take dynamics are taken to the max. wishville combines the catherine wheel's major strength (dynamics) and combines it with pure pop sensibility. they've nearly perfected that which is the catherine wheel."
"This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, ""The Custom-House."" Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition."
Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. It's big and bright.
"This book is extraodinary. I started reading it expecting it to be boreing. After the first eight pages, I was reading it every free second I got. I can guarantee that anyone will love this book."
I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well. You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased.
"I first read this book when I had to write an existential paper for one of my counseling classes. It was difficult for me to understand at first, but I read it again, and it changed my life in ways. So many times, we look at God and box him/her into compartments. When we do this, we think we have a good handle on who and what God is. Then as time goes on, and we evolve, our thoughts on God no longer relate or apply to our lives. Through the struggle to know, seek and experience God, we many times are disappointed when God and ourselves do not connect. Paul Tillich tells us that through the struggle, we must have absolute faith, and the god who is really God appears in Grace."
"This book was wonderfully imaginative and captivating. It contains all the elements that a fantasy reader could want and more. The action, emotional features, and the bonds of friendship are so clearly shown that it is nearly impossible for a person not to get caught up in it all.Christopher Paolini brings out the hero in his brave, yet young, character, Eragon. Paolini shows us how destiny controls our lives and that we have to accept who we are, no matter how much we wish otherwise. In the end, we may have bigger plans made for us in our lives than we ever could have made for ourselves. Christopher Paolini, my thanks for the wonderful journey!"
"I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!"
Full of very interesting info. which we probably never needed to know Bought for a 14 year old who really liked some of his previous books.
"Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed! He's a Don Juan in the advertising world, who gets zapped by his blow-dryer while drinking some interesting-looking Cabernet. The result? He's given the ability to read women's thoughts. This is distressing, at first. Regressive, too: according to the writers (all women), these Turn-Of-The-Millennium-I'm-Every-Woman women primarily want to feast their eyes on Mel's tooshy. Hear me ROAR! Well, our hero soon learns to use his newfound Superpowers for his own profit, but then . . . ah, but then, the movie suddenly gets very serious. Most of the second act is dull. The movie finally wears out its welcome starting with about the last 15 minutes. Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend . . . which is REALLY What Women Want! (Kidding, kidding -- sheesh)"
"I took a chance ordering this product, because there weren't many reviews. I'm glad I did! I got it a few days ago. Connecting my PC to my TV went fine (basicaly, my TV serves as a second PC monitor now), and after adjusting the screen resolution, the image was perfect. Very little fuzzyness. The quality of the videos I played was very good, and well transfered to the TV. The cables are not super long, something to think about if your PC and TV are far apart. A good choice, and I'll update in a few weeks/months to say how it holds up!"
"The manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed, and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption. I have no idea how this tree looked all put together since I had to repack it and send it back. Thankfully Amazon.com's return policy is generous and swift - they get five stars for service! In the meantime, it was a real tree for me again this year . . . I may try to go with an artificial one next year, but will not order one online again."
"I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the ""misspelled"" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library."
"Remarkably entertaining movie. I still get chills watching the action sequences on my 27"" Television."
"i really enjoyed this dvd ,love every thing that catherine bell is in she is such a good actressthis dvd cane very quickly,thankyou so much.norma east."
I'm new to Jazz and I find that I love this stuff. I guess it's bop. This is a must have album for anyone. I highly recommend. I got it on vinyl which is still one of the best ways to hear music. Love it!
"Ah! Colin Firth...the ultimate, consumate actor in a variety of roles. A delightful diet of films...one a day plus a bonus for the week-end and one can have a film festival all their own!!"
The Nantucket Blend is one of my favorite k-cup coffees that I've made. It's a medium blend coffee that tastes great with flavored creamer or just regular creamer or milk. I will definitely buy more of this one.
I expected this to be a large book like the other Good Old Days books that I bought. It is only 16 pages. I do not blame the seller. I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it.
"Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins, (Icluding monacolins KA form).The FDA will not allow these companies to print this on the label. They want everyone reliant on large pharma. This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin (thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels) a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80, for excellent absorption."
"Trollope is addictive, but some of his books offer more nonstop entertainment than others, and this is one of those."
I love Bodysense products.They stay hot for a long time. I use them in my massage practice as hot packs. The smell is great and it lasts quite awhile. The only thing is as large as it is you need a big microwave to heat it. I wind up folding it then it stops roatating so I have to stop and adjust it. UGH it is a pain. Haven't figured out how to arrange so it heats evenly. Otherwise I love it.
"Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne and the rest of the crew(Liam Neeson,Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Morgan Freeman) make this film the best Batman movie yet.The director takes a different course than previous films,Batman Begins is dark and sinister.We see why Bruce Wayne turned to crime fighting.The film is chock full of suspense,action and high tech gadgets.The HD DVD version is a flawless transfer and a worthy addition to your collection."
"I try everything new, hoping to find something that will show me some results right away and give me back the glow in my skin that seems to wither away as time passes (and I'm only 36!) --Anyway, when I read about rice bran, I thought why not - this brand contains a lot of rice bran - it's like the 2nd ingredient in everything after water, and there is nothing else in it I couldn't pronounce. The stuff smells great, and goes on non-greasy, especially the face cream it's like my face is so thirsty for it that it just sucks it all in. The TrueRenu store gives you cute little pahmplets with details on all the ingredients, and insturctions (the packages are written in Japanese so you need to read their instructions) - and I even got a free gift of green tea - yum!"
A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
"When my 6 year old niece was diagnosed with brain cancer last year, my family was devastated. Her parents are both RNs, and so could more easily understand a lot of the terminology and treatments. I have absolutely no medical background, and I found this book to be very helpful. This book provided comprehensive explanations of various treatments, commonly used drugs, different types of brain and spinal cord tumors, etc. that were easy for a layperson to understand. I also really liked that there were many shared experiences from other families who had dealt with childhood cancer, it made me feel like we weren't alone. There are new treatments that come out all the time, so obviously some of the information may be dated, but overall I thought this was an excellent guide for anyone caring for a child with brain cancer."
Who is Joe Nickell? What are his qualifications for these research endeavors and the knowledge to properly assess all parameters involved in scientific research?
"The story is adventure and adventure. Exciting and thrilling, it left me breathless. The characters were so real and compelling."
This is one bad [rear] group! I have both of their albums and the only problem is that I listen to them so much that I can't get the songs out of my head.Killer lyrics and wonderful beats. You won't be disappointed.
"I get 4-5 shaves with each razor, after that it causes pimples. I find it too expensive, but there is no better alternative."
"I only saw about a third of this movie, but i thought it rocked. And i think Freddy oughtta get a girl, just not Heather, as that one guy suggested. Anyway, my question is, how can a kid sleepwalk with his eyes open if he's completely aware of what's going on around him? Maybe i'm misintrepreting, but i saw this movie when i was nine, four years ago, and i recall Dylan sleepwalking into the middle of the street on his way home from the hospital, and Kreuger grabbing him from the sky. The kid was wide awake, so how the heck did Kreuger do it? I mightta missed something, though. I loved the movie, and i'm gonna work on that whole Bride of Kreuger idea this one guy had. Buh-bye."
"I bought this for my Suzuki Boulevard C50 because I wanted a washable filter that lasted a long time. I heard people talking about how a K&N filter gave them extra power. I didn't really believe all that, but after I installed this filter on my bike, there was a small yet noticeable increase in power. I am happy! Extra performance on a washable filter that will last me for the life of the bike."
"I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they're scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it. And then maybe memorize it.A quick read, and a fairly easy read. Engrossing enough that you won't want to put it down, and once you finish it, you might be tempted to just start over and read it again. I recommend doing just that."
"This book was terrible, it was an expolitation of his brother, and a shameless way to promote his other books. No matter the situation, the author found a way to make a reference to another book he had wrote. It was poorly written, and jumps around quite a bit. Don't waste your time or money on this book, or any book of this author's."
"Excellent music that carries a fantasic sense of Place. To my knowledge, Kyle Thompson is the only musician ever to record Civil War-era music ON LOCATION at different battlefields. Thompson is a talented musician and the fact that he had been diagnosed with Lou Gherig's disease by the time of the recording (something I found out after hearing the CD) just made it that much more poignant. The music on the CD is a balanced mix of lighter and darker music. The joy and humor come through in the upbeat songs while the tragedy and sadness of the War comes through the solemn pieces in a way that more glib, nauseously cheery musicians would never be able to communicate."
"the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books I have ever read. I almost have to read them alonme because I get the whole family looking askingly when I laugh out loud. Great stories, obviousl;y fantasy but so real. And if you love word play you will never find better"
"We spent $90 on this tv. It worked fine for 95 days or so. Then the tv goes out. You push the power button and nothing happens. We have tried different outlets and everything. And guess what, it only has a 90 day warranty on labor. And the labor is $60!!! Don't buy it."
"Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stopping numbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in a Westend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even ""Solitaire"" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"
I've seen this band 2 times and believe me both times I wish they wernt on the bill. They are by far the worst band ever and if you like them you should be kicked in the head until theres nothing left of you. Seeing them live is like being kicked in the head anyway.
The book is about a young hobit that goes on an adventurer to get rid of a ring that if you w where it you turn e ebook
"Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book's writter, Dorie Greenspan I ordered it immediately!!Well, the DVD arrived today and it is only a minute fraction [i.e., only 8 shows from this far more extensive series] selection of the books recipes. What a misleading dissapointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherewise.Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.However, the nature of this post is ""Buyer beware"""
"FANTASTIC!! AMAZINGLY THRILLING!! Paolini deserves an A+! very original, action packed, and all out cool, this book is defenatly a best seller!! by the way,Saphira was so well developed, I pictured the perfect dragon in my mind. NO young author can out-write this master of the English language!"
"James Earl Jones butchers the narration of this 'live' presentation (he was far worse on the actual broadcast: this has been slightly edited!) and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible. This show was a classic example of the overkill that came after ""JFK"" came out in late 1991---everything good, bad, and ugly came out in book and tv form...this is one of the ugly moments.Vince Palamara"
I ordered this so I could watch it for a paper. Too bad it never arrived and I had to scramble at last minute to find a copy.
"I received mine yesterday and returned them today. The uppers are glued to the sole in a haphazard fashion. Once you put them on, you can feel the edges where the uppers are glued and clipped on the inside. I doubt they would last long. Glue is not the way to go. They should be stitched. Shoddy workmanship all the way around. I am sorry I paid for the shipping to get them. and the shipping to send them back. All in all, $16 to find out they were shoddy. Never again!"
"This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers. Dumas' writing style losesenergy in the abridging process. The reader ought tobe aware that the story has been simplified and summarized.If you want the true flavor of Dumas, order the unabridgedversion."
the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.
"Folks,For several years, the Russian music scene has exploded with a wealth of talent. Tatu is not the best Russian group, but they are pretty good, their music is very catchy. And...if you listen to the Russian versions, they're even more hypnotic.\According to people in Russia, Tatu is a kids band, a little 2nd rate, but what the heck, the songs are great, good melodies...I sing to them! My only problem is I heard them first as Russian songs, now they have been transformed into English!Perhaps someday the USA will be graced by even better artists, like Alsou Safina, someone who is a serious singer and can sing extrememly well."
"The Series2 will record only one non-digital station and one digital. Now that Comcast has gone all-digital, your Series2 has become more like a Series0.50, since it only records one channel at a time."
I had used Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener in the past... LOVED it... couldn't find it in any stores anymore so went on line... was THRILLED that I could still get it... Love it....ordered three !!! :)
"I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly."
I've built three computers for family using this case and they all love it. A bit wider than the sandard case but about half the height. Glossy black piano finish.... it only appears cramped if you fail to plan... I use modular P/S and tie down all the cords ...getting ready to buy another.
"At first this book was not a book that I wanted to read, It was assigned to me as an English project I.S.U (Independent Study Unit) so like every kid in high school I started to dread it. As I started to read though, the story started to get better and better. There were points where I just wanted to continue reading and not put it down. The story is very well written, it gives you a very good idea as to what a Dystopian world could potentially look like. Although at the beginning it does start out very slow, it is a very good read.If you read this book and enjoyed it, also take a look at ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley. It is quite similar to ""1984"""
"I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong, quirky individual by mid-book she's so hung up on Jake that she looses her charm and strength of character. Jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy. The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further. That, and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well, once again a female character ""melts"".....pun intended. I guess I had anticipated stronger female and male characters, the ones I get from ... I think Ms Wells shows promise but the next book I'll get from the library."
"This book was given to me. I read it and placed it on my book shelf. As a writer, I have used the quotes in articles and letters. A perfect addition to your library if you write to or about children."
"Purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son. He started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed. Previously we were using Dr. Sch**** for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts. So, after some research I decided to give Pedifix a shot. It is working very effectively so far! No pain at all when he applies it. This is my 1st review written on Amazon, but not my 1st reading of reviews. I glean a lot of info from reading and analyzing reviews. I am glad I chose this product."
"Laugh and Learn About Childbirthexcellent information, and humorous all at the same time !!!"
"This is a set book for the University course I'm following. To be honest, I've not read it all. I've read the introductory chapter and picked at the rest of the book.I'm disappointed that other reviewers suggest that this book is well written and academic. It's a rambling incoherent mess of ideas that proposes large-scale state censorship/'perception control' and as such has no place in universities which should protect the ideals of academic freedom and free speech. The net is not considered as a political forum, rather there is a heavy authoritarianism.I'm very disappointed with it."
"worked but a weird deal, not sure if my computer was the problem or this thing....i cant say it is bad or good sorry..."
"Bilbo Baggins ( voiced by "" Orson Bean"") is a Hobbit that goes on a simple quest with Gandolf ( John Huston) and a bunch of Dwarfs that must find Gold from the evil Dragon "" Smaug"". A highly entertaining and all-around fun yet excellent Rankin-Bassfilm which is one of the best they did with "" Return of the King"", "" The Last Unicorn"", and "" Flight of Dragons"".Also recommend: Lord of the Rings ( 1978), Return of the King,and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings."
"Jennifer Love Hewitt is the only bright spot in this mind dulling dribble. The script leaves you not caring for the characters. I can't say the words to descibe this movie. There is maybe one or two semi funny scenes in the whole 90 min of boredom. If you like daydreaming buy this DVD, because you'll be so bored your mind will be wandering in thousands of directions."
"Purchased this set of sheets on April 16, 2011, only two months ago. The fitted sheet have started piling, which indicates not a good quality set of sheets. The only thing that I loved about these sheets is the fitted sheet and how it hugs the mattress. For the price of these sheets the quality is just not there. The sheets that these replace were 5 years old and just started ripping, two months is unacceptable.Sincerely,Jody M Becnel"
"For the last week I have been like a little child waiting for a birthday present to come in the mail. I have joyfully anticipated receiving this boxed set of C.S. Lewis treasures. At last, it came today. What a disappointment! If the covers of these books last through more than one reading, I will be surprised. The covers are beautiful, but the quality is poor, and certainly not worth the $47.90 I paid for this set. I was looking forward to something that would last for years to come. Oh well, I won't be sending the set back, because I'm anxious to read these incredible works (the first books I will have read in several years). If this review was about C.S. Lewis, it would be five stars. But, this review is about the shoddy quality of this set, and hence the single star review. Buyer beware."
This isn't just a history book laced with photos; this is also a personal view on the Cultural Revolution from the photographer's point of view. Informative and emotional at the same time. Wonderful.
"This review is for CD version. I agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch American English dictionary.Some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary. This could be a problem for the printed version. For CD version, this is not a problem. When looking up a word, I cannot tell if it is from the original or from the new word list.I do not understnad why the multimedia function is not on the CD. If it uses too much hard disk space, it can be made available from CD, as Random House did. No pronouncing symbols can compare with the real sound."
"This brooch is far too small and expensive for its size. I was shocked when I pulled it out of its pouch. May I iterate, it is far too small. Without a moment's hesitation this brooch was immediately returned."
"This player is great for DVDs, unfortunately I bought the player for its 5 disc cdr/mp3 playability. The player makes 2 second jumps on every song of every cdr I own. I took it in to get fixed. When I got it back, I plugged it in and still does the same thing."
I am waiting for my full body hazmat protection suit to come in the mail. Afterwards I will order this unit. Great price!
"Secret of the Wild Child tells the compelling story of Susan Wiley, a young girl who was rescued from a dysfunctional home during the 1970s by a system that ultimately failed her. Nova explores her journey from Hell to Limbo in an unforgettable documentary that shows the darkest sides of humanity and the captivating innocence of a child. You too will be haunted by this beautiful girl whom everybody simply referred to as Genie.I would so love to own a copy of this DVD!"
"I have read the first book out of the four (Windows 2000 Professional (70-210). Studied it inside and out. Took the sample test in the CD-ROM and got 98% on it. I thought I was ready for the exam so I went and took the 70-210 exam. Well, this book did not even come close to what the exam was like. The questions were much, much harder and longer scenerio type. I did not pass the exam. If you are looking to just learn Windows 2000 Professional really well, then these books are good. If you are looking to take the MCSA or MCSE exams then don't count on these books to help you pass."
"The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job."
"Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk."
"I was very dissapointed by this movie. It did not do well at the box office, and everyone else I know who saw it, did not like this movie. The story and all the characters are quite stupid.Everyone has a different sense of humor so I won't tell you what is and isn't funny, but due to popular opinion you may want to borrow or rent this movie if you intend to buy it.I am not in the bussiness of giving poor ratings, but I hope I can save you a few bucks."
"this album especialy the tittle cut remedy makes me think that he really knows how woman want to be treated. keep up the good work we really need ""brothas"" out there that still think like you."
"I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don't mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who's educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed."
"great book for those interested in orthodox spirituality. for more look for ""the way of the pilgrim"""
"The animated Hobbit has for years been one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD is similar to what you would get if you copied a worn VHS tape onto a disk. The movie is so dark in many places you can only see dim shapes moving about. The theme song even has a skip in it and there are a number of other skips in the soundtrack. There are also several places where a second or so of the movie is duplicated and repeated. I have no idea how they messed that up! If i had purchased it locally, i would return it, but i guess i will keep it until they decide to fix this dvd and reissue it, hopefully on a blu-ray. My recommendation is Do Not Purchase this version unless you really cannot live without a copy, any copy."
"Dino Esposito has total, absolute command of the subject matter that he expertly teaches in this book. This is a template for how all technical training books should be written. I wanted in-depth coverage of the XML object library in .NET and that is exactly what this book delivers. This is THE book on XML in .NET. Don't waste your money on anything else.It is also terrific supplemental material for the Developing XML Web Services and Server Components certification exam. I recommend Mike Gunderloy's book as an all-encompassing source (look up my review for that book); however, I recommend reading the first four chapters of this book before you start Gunderloy's book if you don't have much experience reading and writing XML in .NET. Chapters 12 and 13 on remoting and web services, respectively, are also great sources of exam prep material. In fact, Chapter 12 on .NET Remoting is the best chapter on the subject you will find anywhere.Terry, MCAD and MCSD for Microsoft .NET"
"While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, ""accidental"" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come."
West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
"This is bad. Really. Perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it. It does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film. Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment: boring, boring and boring. For that alone, it will burn in cinematic hell."
"The picture is extremely shoddy in this Blu-Ray release! Avoid like the plague, so the studio gets the idea! What the heck is the studio doing releasing this atrocious transfer on BD when the movie itself is such a great one? Unbelievable! A movie like this should have a flawless transfer! Argh!"
This movie starts out funny but towards the movie the storyline gets pretty old. Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie. And its super boring and not funny. My favorite part was when it was over.
"Bad. Just plain awful. Please skip this mindless drivel. The only people who liked this film are girls who think that Vin Diesel is ""cute"" and people who liked ""Fast & The Furious"" (another snoozer). I am glad that I saw it on my friend's PC and not at the theaters, so that I didn't waste $7.50. Anyone who watched this film and was not insulted by its mindnumbing dialogue, horrid plot and overall crudeness should be ashamed of themselves. Not even Jean Claude himself could have saved this one. A total waste of time for the thinking movie goer. Hey kiddies, here's an idea; instead of watching this why not see a top-notch film like ""Far From Heaven"" or ""The Hours"" or even ""Minority Report""? Oh, thats right, gotta use the old noggin for that one....never mind. It saddens me that movies have come to this."
"I love this guided meditation! When I fall for someone, I fall in love really hard and I can have a hard time moving on after a breakup, even though logically I know I should and I want to. This CD helps guide you through your feelings so you can release and move on. Every time I have used it I cry really hard, which is weird to me because I wouldn't expect to before the meditation. Releasing the sorrow is a big part of the healing process. I highly recommend it to anyone after a recent breakup or divorce; or anyone that is having a hard time letting go. This will speed the healing process so you can go out and enjoy life!"
"The book was absolutely wonderful!! But the introduction was written in very bad taste. The insinuations were offensive and with out just cause!!Had I read the introduction before I purchased the book, I would have chosen another copy. I had purchased it and then read the introduction, so as I write, the pages have been cut out of this book. Louisa May Alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person."
"Having read most books on Krishnamurti, I would give this book only two stars. Lutyens decided not to disclose the extent of the personal relationship even though by her own admission she knew about it from Krishnamurti himself. To that extent Sloss is accurate. However, Sloss is living in complete denial by not acknowledging either the culpability of her father who was a court established embezzler of public funds, not to mention her mother who was a married woman at the time she began her relationship with Krishnamurti. There are some other allegations against Krishnamurti as well but the lack of any objective evidence indicates they are likely a projection of personal bitterness. Sloss has certainly not helped her credibility by waiting for several years after Krishnamurti's death to go public with her version of events that took place many decades earlier."
"When I purchased this small hardcover book, I didn't expect very much. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it in one sitting, twice! You will not want to put this one down.LBW is simple, yet romantic. The story originates in Africa with childhood friends, Jacques and Margaret. Margaret moves to London and weds Lord Berkley. When the childhood friends return to Africa, the storytelling becomes richer. Even when they are separated by continents, decades, and lovers, Jacques and Margaret maintain a sweet friendship.This is a must read that is well-written and culturally enlightening."
"One of the best films ever made, Gods and Monsters works on many levels. It presents the many roles men play -- gay/straight, husband/bachelor, parent/child, lover/monster, youth/elderly, whitecollar/bluecollar -- wrapped in a captivating story. Listen for the music; it's hauntingly beautiful."
"This album has British saxophonist Courtney Pine really coasting - smooth & mellow with a predominance of synthesisers & drum programming with no real ""blowing"" or hard edges. Very, very reminiscent of Kenny G with some synthesised reggae inflections & also some rather schmaltzy vocal work. If you like that sort of thing, fine, but in my humble opinion ""smooth"" jazz like this just isn't worth the time or money, given the abundance of truly high quality, inventive jazz available."
"If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces. The book proves one point to me: burning books and their society is much better than ours where Farenheit 451 can be published"
"This seller claims that if not satisfied with the product, they will issue you a refund as long as you send the product back within 30 days. Well is almost a month since I send the products back and I havent seeing no refund yet. I tried calling and sending the seller messages with no luck they wont return my calls or write. I also think that phone number given is fake, because nobody ever answers the phone."
"I didn't like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea. I guess Anne and Gilbert was all grown up in the Continuing Story. Didn't really like the war atmosphere, felt so sad."
"The subtitle should be, ""Inside the Port-o-Johns at Bethpage Black,"" because Feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course, every last one, even one that Tiger briefly did some business in! The guy who unloaded the Port-o-Johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause, but we get page after page of this guy. You'd think he was the Pope of Bethpage Black. If you want to know fascinating stuff like the PRECISE NUMBER of Port-O-Johns that actually lined the golf course, then attempt to burrow your way through Open. The playing of golf -- I'm talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament -- doesn't make its first appearance until page 256. At that point, the book is more than two-thirds over!!!Feinstein phoned this one in. Did someone edit this? He should have called it, ""A Good Open Spoiled."" Don't waste your money."
The filter was exactly as identifed when ordered. It was shipped promptly and packaged well enough to protect it during shipment.
"I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching. I really couldn't stand Sam's new model girlfriend. She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily. I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar. Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon. Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building. There's foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they're going to be taking refuge in a glass building. What could possibly go wrong?"
"On the one hand, you've got the nuthouse dramas where the mental patient provides deep truths to inmates and staff alike (Don Juan DeMarco; Cuckoo's Nest). On the other hand, you've got the Taoist alien dispensing generic new-age advice (Starman). Trying to mix the two was a BIG mistake. This movie was way too long, way too slow, too self-involved and overall just dull. Kevin Spacey has done some fantastic work (Seven; American Beauty; Usual Suspects) but this is isn't it. Also, someone said the ending was ambiguous. Not true. Prot is Robert Porter."
"This book is very brief, but I guess this is how its supposed to be since it seems Frank Herbert wanted it to be a link between Dune before Paul, and the Dune after Paul. The end of the book is the perfect way to take us to the next stage, the children of Muadib."
"If you remotely enjoy Jane Austin's works, this story is sure to please. Anne Hathaway is stunning and believable as Jane Austin. James McAvoy portrays young Jane's love interest and their chemistry is fantastic. Romantic, witty, Sad, funny, passionate - all things that make a great ""chick"" flick. You'll wish it wouldn't end. One word to the wise - Don't subject your husbands / boyfriends to this movie or you'll never hear the end of it."
"Did I read a different book from everyone else? I thought this was horrible! I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then, this whiny main character that, regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove Sabin is an honest, honorable man, she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way. Yet, he continues to chase her, help her and love her regardless. When everything is added up, Moriah doesn't deserve a man like Sabin. Lastly, to top it all off, after she's unloaded abuse after abuse on him, he simply tells her he's a good guy and she's like, oh, well, in that case I believe you and I love you. How utterly stupid! His actions obviously mean nothing, but she'll listen to what he says--wham--bam!Terrible, just terrible!"
"A tantalizing performance by Kathleen Turner. Anyone with a soul sometimes wants to go back in life to discover the great "" what if"" In this film Peggy Sue gets that chance to possibly change her life by going back ..there!Turner pulls it all off in grand style. The realities she learns are not as profound as she might think they are. Nevertheless , viewing this film might provoke a "" thought"" journey because its done so well and with care. Watch for Leon Ames and other older stars.Written by Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner."
"If you have never used a flat iron before, don't even bother.This product does not come even close to the results I get when i use my flat iron. A waste of money, to say the least."
"I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder. I have sprayed all furniture, bedding, hard to reach spaces,etc. And a month later I still have fleas. It is a major waste of time and money."
"Camus's novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life. He creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind's true state. The novel makes the reader question their own lapse into the existentialist circle and why it happens. In short, it is one of the classics."
So he's a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don't know why I continued to watch.
"I have never read a book that was so boring. The book talked about a jewish girl helping out a nazi. Nothing happens inthe begining and the climax is the girl housing the nati. WOW,NOT! Weas a class read this book as a class and i asked everyone what they thought of the book. They all agreed with me!"
"It is way too hard to get this stuff off after use! If you happen to touch anything but your body, it is on there for good. The bottle itself develops a super greasy feel immediately after the first use. Go with the ID Glide water based lube instead. Millennium costs twice as much, is a total mess, and doesn't feel nearly as good. My GF hates this stuff too so it was a total loss!"
My children love the content but I can't let them read the book for too long.Double the size of the font and print it in a larger format would be better.
"After reading several reviews, I ordered these, but they never arrived and I was reimbursed the purchase price, so I went to a local sporting goods store and compared these to theNikon 10x42 Monarch. After comparing the two, even though the Monarch's were more money. The Monarch 10x42 is a lot better quality Binocular. And I have been very happy with them ."
"If I could give this a negative rating I would. I guess I was unlucky. Installed batteries, light would NOT shut off. I figured I would just ""break"" the lights since I only needed the fan. Well before I could do that, the fan went out."
"Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing."
"I've honestly heard this entire album, I'm glad that I didn't buy it. Everything sounds almost the same and I find myself getting bored with his voice. I'm a big fan of everyone on AI, so I listen to every song first before I judge. I would say Kelly Clarkson and Ruben Studdard's CD's are better than this. Please, do yourself a favor and buy those instead, not this. I would recommend maybe downloading some of Clay's songs, but don't spend your money."
"With the slinging of rubber playground balls and the realistic sound of the ball hitting and stinging its mark (how'd they capture that!) and the bathroom humor, this could have been a movie that I enjoyed with my children! HOWEVER, the sexual innuendo and outright poor language, as well as the girl-girl kiss and ""crotch enhancement"" received by the Stiller character makes this a movie that I'm tossing in the trash can. What a drag!"
I saw this book at the Dahn Yoga and Healing Centers where I attend classes. I have had basic and advanced Healing training from Dahn Yoga and our last class was how to make healing water. This book illustrates what anger and violence as well as pollution do to our bodies which are made up of 70% water. My daughter borrowed the book the day after I got it and I am waiting for her to return it. Every human being should read this book and understand how their actions react on other humans. Superb book!

I now have a complaint against combi pending and now must purchase a new seat because i will not put her in this one!!!!!!!!!do not purchase!!!!! who only knows what the material is made of( it was made in Italy)less then 1 star
"This CD is not Touch Sampler 5, which has not yet been released. This is Touch Sampler 00, released to commemorate the millenium. It's a nice CD, and the track listing is right, but the product title is incorrect. See [...]"
"First of all, I saw the review by ""Tyley Mike ""Relite"""" and thought he was grossly overcritical of EVERYTHING and every instrument played... so I'd like to hear Tyley Mike's album, since he thinks he can do better :) --seriously! I think some people don't understand that things sound the way they were MEANT to sound, if they sound poppy, they made it that way, why the hell should they stick to the norm? They want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds great.I can't write a good enough review for this album, all their albums actually, as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting. It bugs me when a group doesn't evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were, all the time, so I was glad to see them progress and ""grow"".There's too much to say to describe this album, but frankly I don't think I could write a good enough review to do it justice, so I'll just give it my 5 stars :)"
"Danny Kaye was a gifted comic actor who not only touched and entertained millions of children, but at his best, brought out the child in all of us. A hilarious spoof on the swashbuckler picture, ""The Court Jester"" is widely regarded as his finest screen hour. With lots of color, action and excitement framing the immortal gags, this is family entertainment at its best ."
"Again, a good product, but over priced. I would try to find some gently used ones."
"I love this cd. My favorite song is ""Gills and Tails."" I have been following her music since she was with Groove Theory. True talent. She is soooooooooooo under rated. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AMEL!!!!"
"years ago when the original whitestrips first came out, i tried them. i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected. fastforward a handful of years and i have decided to try the premium strips. i'm getting braces in a month, and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment. i used the premium strips for 30mins lastnight and i had amazing results from only one strip! if my teeth keep whitening like this, i will have to stop using them before the box is done to prevent having the unnatural 'hollywood glow'. i was blown away!"
"By far, one of the best books ever written. I felt as if I was in the book taking part of the adventure. John Steinbeck has made it clear that he is among the elite writers in the margin between William Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe.The feeling you get is indescribable when you read this book. The story of when George and Lennie will have their own land, and Lennie could finally raise rabbits - just gives you your own sense of liberty.Please, if you are sensitive and/or depressed, be aware. This book is great, but very depressing."
"My almost-5-month-old has never had any diaper other than a Pampers diaper on his body! I swear by Pampers!But, even though they are less expensive, the Baby Dry type are not worth it! I found them cheap looking and feeling (they could have been mistaken for a store brand.) The absorbancy in the seat of the diaper was so bad, my son would wake up from a short nap and the seat of his outfit would be wet (there was not a fit issue, he was the correct weight for the size I bought, and the leakage was not from the top of the back or sides of the diaper, but literally from the seat.) From now on, I will definitely stick with the Pampers Swaddlers type."
The material was as described and was delivered on schedule. The packaging was less than adequate since the bar broke through one end cap of the shipping tube. Otherwise it would be five stars.
"This game is fun, exciting, and easy to learn how to play. I got this for Christmas last year, and I still love to play. Trust me, I have a very short attention span and a complex mind and found this game great.Pros:*cool monsters to raise*tournaments to win*many secret breeds to unlock*many tasks to accomplish*lots of monsters to pick from*challenging for pro gamers*enjoyable for untalented gamers*rules aren't confusing*good graphicsCons:*people talk a lot*monsters only have 4-5 year life spansThis game is varied so that a variety of people can enjoy. At first it is Ahhh,uhhh, okay. Then once you understand, it becomes great fun.I had this game in fifth grade and my friend and I shared so much laughter and good memories. This is a good game for anyone, so try it."
this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. Read something substantial for a change!
"Though the price is something you have to consider most, I love the vest, style, quality and even the color. My son got the blue one and he loves it from the beginning. It's very soft, comfortable and stylist that helps him floating very well, of course with the help of his father to make his head up. It doesn't take long for a 2-year-old boy to get used to it too. Not like the fabric vest, this one doesn't stick to his skin and it dries out very quick. We had a very good time in the pools and had a hard time to pull him out of the water. Absolutely a good purchase, it deserves every penny."
"This book has too much of everything... except action.There isn't much of a story and it's way too long.There's a lot of endless talk about the same subjectsand lots more sex than any other Asimov book. Theother Foundation books were fine for all ages. This onehas way too much adult content. I think that 300 pagescould easily have been cut out. In fact, to get to thereal story, just skip to the last 40 pages. Boring.Long. It dishonors the enitre series."
"I will not rehash all the explanations on the problems with the Gladiator Blu-ray - please read the other reviews for a technical explanation. Suffice it to say there is a ""new"" version that has been cleaned up and looks gorgeous and there is an ""old"" version that is junk. The old version was so bad that the studio recognized it and decided it needed to be corrected.But guess what, Amazon insists on clearing out their old stock and selling you the junk version. I ordered this last week and figured there is no way they would be doing this. But guess what, I WAS WRONG.Here's a giveaway - on the cover of the case there is a mail in rebate that expired in JUNE 2010!!!Absolutely pathetic showing by Amazon."
"I like the video but it jumps ahead. For the 20 minute workout, i'm done in 15! The 60 minute program is more like 40.i think of all of the tutorials, i have seen only 1 all the way through and most, it just skips over them. It is horrible! I tried this but the video is such poor quality that it makes it difficult to feel it is doing any good."
"I can't rave about this book enough, It was required reading for a literature of the outdoors class I took in college a decade ago and I've probably read it 20+ times since then. My copy is tattered, highlighted and written all over. Growing up in rural Utah I feel Abbey's pain towards the paving and developing of these beautiful areas. I crave the solitude that he writes about, understand the attachment towards random small creatures and can't help but laugh and nod my head in agreement at his rants. Anyone who spends time in pristine wilderness, redrock desert or not, will appreciate this read."
I bought this little toy at a local auto mart and it has saved the day. It holds the charge for weeks and has never failed me in jumpstarting a car. I leave it in my wife's car during the winter months in case her battery doesn't start and it works great.Definitely a high recommendation.
I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.
"Actually everything in the book IS helpful, and a OK read... but most of the material is FREE on the net already.The stuff from ""The Layguide"" was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print. If you search for keywords like ""layguide"" and ""player guide"" on the net, you will find this stuff is basically plagaurized. It was just a compilation of a bunch of usenet posts.Now, if you really want something in print, and original too, do yourself a favor now and go buy ""The Art of Seduction"" by Robert Greene, also available here on Amazon.com. The guy researched great seducers and seductions throughout history, and came up with types of seducers, the stages of seduction, etc. And his work is entirely original as well."
cheeks grove is the hook on this cd . chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch band....worth a listen BIG DADDY
"Absolute worst movie that I have ever seen, I never write movie reviews but this was so bad and hopelessly boring that I felt obligated to say something......Heres the movie: Guy stumbles around his house mumbling to himself in a dress with a shotgun...treated to a full boyz2men video on a tv...guy stumbles around and sits in a greenhouse mumble mumble...silence and camera focused on a bush for 2 mins...guys drunk friends come to his house guy plays a song 2 guys kiss and lay on eachother in bed...guy makes mac and cheese....guy dies in his greenhouse.....awesome movie....makes me want to watch dude wheres my car"
"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. ... He makes incredible errors of historical fact-well known historical fact, at that. For heaven's sakes never mind his errors regarding the women's lives, he puts Warm Springs (where FDR died) in West Virgina instead of Georgia(and where were his editors?) His lack of understanding of the truth of women's lives is no worse than many otherwise credible male biographers. Read it with a spoonful of salt, and you will learn of many women who have been overlooked. Just know going in that you are reading what amounts to a shallow overview magazine type article. Not unenjoyable just disappointing. I ignored the whole rating thing which is absurd."
"i haven't watched this movie. it was purchased for a christmas present. i heard about this movie on american family radio and they gave it wonderfuly reviews. my brother is ex-military and loves these types of movie. since afr gave them a wonderful review, i thought this would be something that he would enjoy."
"When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing, I was very unhappy with this movie as all the shot of the surfing scene are taken from a helicopter. Its a nice introduction to big wave surfing but nothing compare to riding giants or the billabong odisey. The rock climbing was also so so. The snow board scenes are nice as always but nothing special.Overall this blu ray is good but doesnt show you anything new or that you event seen before."
"We outgrew our 8x8 tents with the kids, so we bought this tent preparing for our next camp trip. We test it out at our back yard right after we bought it. It's easy to set up, and roommy. However, the zippers are done in very low end quality. The window zippers work ok, but both the door zipper did not work well! The mesh zipper will open up after you zipped it. The door zipper is not well stiched on one side! And it's hard to zip it around.We are return it back to the store tomorrow!"
"Like others here, I'm wondering if the final seasons of one of the most durable, laugh-out-loud sit-coms of all timewill ever be released. I bought Season 1 for a song when Borders went out of business,expecting a series I loved at the time to have dated badly. It hadn't.A great cast, with fine, funny writers and performed (I believe) before a live audienceI quickly caught up and, like the rest of you, have a feeling that I've pre-ordereda box-set that, inexplicably, will never be released. When already? Ever?"
"This is a fine Randolph Scott film. Unfortunately the DVD has interference on the audio channel (bass-heavy contemporary music, as if someone was playing something through the board when the transfer was made) and the print itself shows damage in places. I have never encountered a major studio release with this level of audio interference. Thanks for caring, Columbia Pictures!"
"First of all, Ike is doing the very thing that Tina always said he would do. Ike Turner will never admit to what he did to Tina. Tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like ""all the others."" Ike took advantage of her. Tina her self said she cared very much for him. Cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince Tina to leave him. Even the girls that danced with Tina on stage had whitnessed what happened.Tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career, she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. So she released her autobiography in 1986, well after her come-back in 1984.While Ike can try to deny it all he wants, the truth is he violently abused Tina! And considering the person Ike Turner is, I would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!!"
"I used to enjoy Tom Brokaw when he was NBC anchor man as a critical and competent journalist. His book however is a real disappiontment. For me, belonging to the post-war generation, it reads as a very shallow ""hurra-patriotism"" story, without any ctitical investigation of the time priode he covers. Not everything this generation did was so great and I would have expected from a critical journalist like Tom Brokaw to take this aspect into consideration as well. In this sense it is not very demanding book."
"Got these to put in my camper, great for a low watt system. I am surprised at the bass response in these little speakers. I wouldn't put them in a high power system (they are rated at 75 watt) but for a low watt system they sound very good and look great too."
"We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes."
This item doesn't even look like the one the picture... It's not the real thing and it's a bootleg one..
product is great. works like it's supposed to. order processing and shipment speedy and efficient
This was a interesting season for the show. Everytime you watch the show you learn and see something different.
"I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors, Save $8 by not buying this product ...Very thin and very large sized shirts .... they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site ..."
"As mentioned by other reviewers, this DVD is just horrible to watch because of the absurd amount that the cameras cut away to another scene every few seconds. If you want to watch a guitar solo or anything else for that matter to absorb any details, forget it! The editor(s) didn't do the Scorpions justice. The music is good, but since this is a DVD and not a CD, I'm giving two stars for the spazoid video technique."
"What a terrible movie, garbage. It totally sucks. What is Hollywood coming to. It seems they are running out of stories to make movies about. What garbage. Good Lord. Right up there with Boondock Saints 2 and Smokin Aces 2."
"This movie is in my personal top 10 - which just shows how much I enjoyed it. It may not be art, but by gum, it's cracking good fun. The comedy is suitably black and nasty, the tension is very palpable, and the concept - well, the concept may not be absolutely original (what is, these days?) but it is very good. I think very highly of it as an example of how good a horror movie should be, ironic, intelligent, sassy, smart and well-acted. The monsters are JUST this side of credible, which makes it all the more riveting. Last night, I was walking across three deserted football pitches on campus and suddenly remembered this movie - and had to keep reminding myself that it was JUST a movie. That is the sign of a successful ""beast"" horror movie. It relies upon common sense, a humourous screenplay, actors who do not ham any more than is necessary, and a general atmosphere of cracking good fun. Brilliant stuff."
"I would consider myself a ""radio"" Damn Yankees fan, having only heard their radio hits like, ""Don't Tread on Me,"" and, ""High Enough."" After hearing this Essentials CD though, I see that there's more than meet's the ear. The only song on here that I can't seem to get into is, ""Come Again,"" but all the others are real rockers for me. From the milder, ""Silent is Broken,"" to the fast and heavy, ""Piledriver,"" this CD never stops! The guitars, vocals, bass, and drums, all rock. I tend to give conservative ratings, so that's why I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, but otherwise, I would highly recommend it for any other ""radio"" fans like myself."
"i purchased a sony clie pegt615 on 08-15-02 at compusa/madisonWi. I found that it didn't beam and took it back for an exchange model, same item only to find that this one didn't beam either. (the technician at the store confirmed the defect). i decided to reverse the purchase for cash. on our way out ot the store we found that the display model had the same defect.this tok a hunk of time out of our short vacation unfortunately not with a happy ending.angie siewert"
"excellent and cheap...panning acts almost like the $400+ tripods for movie cameras...and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of ""shaky"" movement...sold...stable...tall...worth the price"
Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
"god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider and others contribute voices."
"This is one of the funniest SF books out there. I've got an old tattered copy, and I will order the new edition when it comes out. The book is full of cultural, SF and fandom references. Some might be a little dated (for example, the symbol of the sheep, the horned box, is a reference to a TV with antenna, and how many people have seen one of THOSE lately?), but overall, this book holds up very well.To answer another reviewer's question would be a spoiler, but anyone who wishes to know who Purple was based on can email me at my nickname at hotmail."
"Halloween 3 is the worst horror flick ever made, I would rather eat Guano while sitting on thumbtacks and drinking bile while watching Leprechaun in Space, than watch this 98 minute slaughter of the prestigous Halloween series. What was John Carpenter smoking when he came up with the worst possible idea in the history of horror films. If you purchase this film then you have just donated your hard earned money to foundation of crappy movies! Remember, Have a Happy Halloween From Silver Shamrock!!!!!"
"Although the subject matter was interesting, the lack of pictures and overall layout of the book made it tedious to read. I saw so many opportunities for this book to be better. For example, there were many instances where an accompanying picture would have clarified a description or put it into a better context. A specific example of this is where she mentions a nail belt. It would have been illuminating to see a picture of one on that page. The writing style to me seemed dry, almost ""textbook""."
"I bought the XL case of Pampers Baby dry in size 3 and after only 5 diapers my son has a horrible rash on his entire back where the diaper touches.My son's skin is not sensitive and we have used Pampers swaddlers, Hugggies Snugglers,Huggies Snug n Dry, Parents Choice and Comforts (kroger) brand and he has never had any issue.now I am stuck with this XL case of diapers."
"This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly. The reader feels so very sorry for George. George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged. This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it. The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about "" a stranger killing my old dog"" are so very sad! One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does. This is a beautiful book!"
"I've had my 940MW for over a year. When 1st received, after turning on, it would work for 5 to 10 minutes and then cut off. I tried removing and re-pluging in the power cord and it would work for a few minutes and then the monitor would again cut off. Then I tried a different approach. I removed the power cord and squeezed the end that goes to the monitor with regular pliars. SINCE THEN, THE MONITOR HAS NOT 'TURNED ITSELF OFF' ONCE!I believe that what was happening, in my case anyway, was the power cord connection at the monitor would heat up and expand and break the flow of AC. Squeezing the power cord with the pliars 'tightened up' the connection allowing the cord to maintain contact. I looked at the monitors plug hole after removing the power cord, and the connection lugs were inset into the monitor farther that I think they should be. I think that that caused the problem.Don't know if this helps anyone else.That is the only reason I don't give this monitor a 5 rating."
"there have been others books similar to this one, but nearly ALL of the authors of those books have been trained directly or indirectly by Ron LeGrand. He is truly the guru of real estate investing. This book gives solid, practical advice that works in the real world. Yes, he tries to sell you additional things, but all you have to do is follow the instructions and you will have success.A great book that opened my eyes to a world of possibilities, which included early retirement."
Does not surpass War All The Time but still pretty f-ing solid. Check out Autumn Leaves Revisited.
"Bought the Yepp 700 online exactly a year ago, and it is now broken. The battery case will not shut. (This has happened to many other customers. BUYER BEWARE.)However, the mp3 player does have nice features.-Good Sized Memory256 mb is alot of storage. You can get about 70 songs with that. Buy the media card. It's cheap.-Slick lookingThe yepp is very nice looking. It is also pretty small. Good to exercise with.-Remote controlIts nice that they put this here, but it is pretty worthless. The LCD is wothless, and the FM tuner on this is EXTREMELY WEAK!- Voice RecorderGood feature.In summary, nice features, but poorly built. If you want to take a chance on the mp3 player, go right ahead."
"I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well, now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series."
We love reading this book to our six month old. It has a rhythm to it that makes it so much fun. The illustrations are adorable and the story-line is very creative. The cardboard books are best for a young baby who likes to turn the pages too.I give this book as gifts all the time.
"Thank your ""Lucky Star"" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called ""movie"" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than ""Body of Evidence"" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it. I want my two hours back."
"With the advancement of Homeland Security here in the United States we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother. The number of agencies FBI, CIA, INS, and other alphabet soup organizations are now cross matching databases. They are gathering information from local municipalities and those that are in the system, better not have anything to hide.September 11th accelerated the path that we were already on. I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment. I just hope that these ""mistakes, misquotes, and misinformed"" changes never occur in such a draconian fashion.Great book. Everyone should have a copy on their shelves."
"I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen, and it had me hooked on SF.Alan Dean has let me down time and time again since, but this book is a classic.You MUST read this one. It'll be fun, and you won't be able to put it down.After finishing this one, try hunting down ""Dark Star"", a movie-novelization that is almost as good as ""Midworld""."
"I read this during vacation, so I had a lot of time. I would ussually take a while to read for me, a ten year old. As I began, I couldn't put it down! I read of the adventures of Kit and Nita as they found, by accident, Fred the white hole; And tryed to get out of a land where there were no humans, only cars and machines with minds. Humans cannot survive in this land! To find out what happened in this great book, read it! (obviously)"
"If your main objective, is the study of human relationships,social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing otherpeople, this movie is for you.Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just,a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script withpeople, relationships, seduction, etc.This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true.Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more funfor some people than others."
"This book is confusing and difficult to follow because the author tries to cover one-night-stands and polygynous dating with the same advice. Basically, you will probably get laid using these tips, but the type of woman you will reel in may not be the type you'd want to see again... ever.For example, what do you think happens when you use money as an incentive to control womens' behavior? She is going to use sex in a similar fashion to control you. Unless she's an idiot. But hey, if you read this book with the goal of getting laid, you're probably into that."
"We bought this so that the stroller could have shade from the front. It was hard to put on and keep stable, and the parts broke easily. Not worth it!"
"I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it, like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery. What a disappointing story!The story had no sense of direction. It seemed badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
"Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance, starting with Plato, and remains one still today. One only has to be reminded of Allan Bloom's chapter on Rock music and the reaction that section provoked shows how powerful this theme remains today. Liberals (ancient and modern, capitalist or not) don't like the idea that music plays a role in character formation.. and what Holloway's book does shows the reader what the big stars of western philosophy has to say on this subject. Holloways argues by ignoring the power of music in the formation of character of the young especially, contemporary society and the music it has bread.. has lead to extremes both in music and people's character.. and both for the worse."
"once again, (OK it does not happen that often, otherwise we would stop trusting Amazon and shopping with them, would'nt we?) the description is not accurate : this version ISBN 1569945233, monterey media etc.... is an ADAPTATION of Dicken's novel by the St Charles PLayers, who record it with all due talent and spirit BUT as a play, in an ""exciting Radio Theater style"" quote, unquote....."
"I didn't find the music relaxing or energizing. I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music. But on the plus side, it made me want to put on a shiny leotard and leg warmers."
"I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone, especially children."
"This book is great if you want to stick to only one medium, Marshall Photo Oils. The examples are sappy and saccharine.Cutesy kids, flowers, bla bla bla! This book copies the style and explanations of Handcoloring Photographs Step by Step by Laird. Thats because Dorskind has nothing to say herself and doesn't know how to explain. Now you should buy the book by Laird. I, like most reviewers recommend it strongly. I also highly recommend to you Handtinting Photographs. Buy this book too. Don't buy Dorskind's book. Its a waste of money."
"If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have one book with me, I would choose this one. It angers me, saddens me, offends me, and elates me. But most of all it inspires me. Each time I read it I uncover something precious and unique. It never grows old. If you truly love all that is convenient and commercialized, if you revel in the gifts technology brings you, don't read it. It's too good for you. If you truly love and are capable of appreciating the serene beauty of the wilderness buy it, read it, then cry. For it's all gone. When you read, read beneath the text. Read deeply into the subtext of this book. It's all about surfaces. Abbey proves that we cannot truly see, experience or appreciate anything unless we can look below the surface as he did."
The rice turned out perfect! Very different from other rice cookers I have tried. I am worried about what the other reviewers mentioned that the battery could out for the LCD display though since I don't intend to plug the machine in all time.
"Horrible movie. I actually laughed a lot, but it's not supposed to be a comedy. The acting was terrible, storyline bad, the way the movie was shot was supposed to be ""arty"" but just ended up looking like a 10 year old child did the camera work. I only gave it one star for a rating because they won't let you review an item without one. If they had a zero star rating, that's what it would get. I am sorry I wasted my money on it."
"If you have some extra time on your and feel like pissing it away, then read this book. I love literature;however, I cannot believe I wasted valuable hours of my life on reading this so called book. I've read technical manuals that are more interesting. If there is someone you really don't like, suggest that they read this book."
"This hair dryer claims to style, smooth and streighten. Don't count on it. I have medium lenghth fine hair and I wish I never bought it. However, it might work on longer hair? Not a high probability. Forget this product and empty promises."
"George Orwell's prophetic words are coming to pass right before my eyes; You'd see it too, if you got off the TV and started paying attention to politicians and the laws they're passing.I hope there is a revolution of some sort before this grim forecast is played out to the end."
"The cover blurb on this book says it all: ""For office slaves, Internet addicts and stressed-out students."" (ha! I am all three) If you are like me and have looked at many a Yoga book but put them aside due to the difficult positions/instructions or the time involved, but still want to feel better, relax and also rejuivinate, AS well as relieve the symptoms of the computer age, then this is the book for you. A definate must-buy!"
"The magic just isn't here anymore. I think that every cramps fiend's affection comes from the fact that these guys struggled through pretty much every kind of hardship a band can face (except for a lack of purpose, drive, and motivation) throughout the wild and wooly days of the early punk scene. even the punks didn't get these guys. This album is just too artificial sounding to be a real cramp's album. it sounds like a novelty album for kids. I loved ""sinners"", though. and for that I gave it another star."

"This novel is one of the best ever written by the greatest author ever. I first read this book when I was in third grade, and still love it five years later. This story was the first to get me into the fantasy genre and it has truly been a marvelous journey ever since. To anyone who enjoys a good story, read this tale of elves, dwarves, dragons, trolls, hobbits, and wizards. Also, if you choose to read this novel, don't forget to read the even better Lord of the Rings Trilogy by the same author. Remember to read this first, however. Don't listen to the other reviews which state that this book is a load of hogwash. It is, in fact, a wonderful adventure that a reader will never forget."
"We visited the Dingle peninsula of Ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there. Turns out that, in addition to having great scenes of the Dingle countryside, it also has a very good story line. And, terrific acting and some Irish history thrown in for good measure."
We have had this sandbox for about a year and it is constantly filling with rain water. Flimsy lid does not fit correctly and Little Tikes will do nothing without a dated receipt within 1yr - basically told us too bad. Buy the Step 2!!!
"This is my second coffee warmer. I lost my first one, a no-name cheap model that worked beautifully, so I bought two of the Mr. Coffee version, one for me and one for my spouse. It really won't maintain the temperature of the coffee until your cup is down to about 1 ounce left. I would not recommend this product. We had the same experience with both Mr. Coffee warmers, so it wasn't a case of a defective item. It just doesn't work."
"Great movie. To date the best version out there. 2 disc! It was great watching it with commentary from fans. This was just awesome. The colour and widescreen format are surperb. Many special features including commentaries, interviews, trailers etc. The Scramble City episode which is a special feature, which I was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary. Only about four toy commercials. There are easter eggs on both discs (old Diaclone toy commercials). Overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended."
"Valeria is now accepted by the Riding School, where gods of patterns and time take the shape of white stallions and help determine the future of the Empire. But she and her teacher, First Rider Kerrec, both carry damage from their encounters with enemies of the Empire. Those same enemies, barbarians who follow the Unmaking (which would lead to the destruction of the world), threaten the Empire again. Can two damaged Riders, and the stallion gods who carry them, help the Empire win a deadly war?While this is the middle book of a trilogy, I preferred it to both the beginning and concluding books. I tend to be a reader of fantasy rather than romance, and I actually think that the romantic triangles/quadrangles in the other two books detracted from the plots of those books. They really felt sort of forced to me."
"Perez-Reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book. It was artsy--too many references to books and movies, as if his characters couldn't emerge out of their actions. That's not the case here. His priests are real. That's a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world. And so's his Vatican. Dibden's CABAL works the same vein, but the comparison is all in Perez-Reverte's favor. He's closer here to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP than to CABAL. Cather gets the 5th star; that's the only reason THE SEVILLE COMMUNION doesn't."
"Having just read Vanishing Florida by David T. Warner, I was anticipating another look into a native's perspective of old Florida. While Warner's book was engaging, enlightening and entertaining, this one was not. It was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author's family which wasn't that interesting."
"I bought these for myself and my son for Aikido weapons training. They are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds. To clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter. One is practically straight with no curve. The handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use. There is also removable plastic guard or tsuba, which is not very functional and more decorative. You get what you pay for and these are not high quality, hence the expensive price. I will eventually buy something better."
"This is quite possibly one of the ten finest Albums/CDs every recorded. The Byrds at this time were the best the 60s had to offer and the 60s was the time period that mattered. The songwriting by Crosby in particular was genius. I love the Byrds, I miss Gene Clark, and I only wish this early version of the Byrds could have given us even more output before the break-ups and decline into the ""Rodeo"" format. Yes, the muscianship of ""Mcguin's"" country Byrds was truly groundbreaking but the songwriting was not even close. Get this one for a real trip."
It was just as good as I remembered! The grand kids (2&4) sat mesmerized for the entire movie! Ttkhanks for the nice afternoon!
"We think that the book, Lord of the Flies, was just 'ok'. It was an intense way of looking at a goodlife. We believe that the message of the novel was always have hope. We thought it could have ended better, but it pulled it all together well. Although we were bored at times, we liked the way Golding had items symbolize ideas. The book was different then ones we have read in the past, therefore, it broadened our views of good versus evil."
A very nice coffee; not overly strong and with nice flavor. The Green Mountain line of coffees are a good choice for the Keurig System.
I liked the author's story but I can't believe all the things that he assumes for what was happening in the Americas before 1492.
item came on time in excellent condition great service hope I can do business with this seller again highly recommended!
"For over $18.00, you do not give the quantity of cans one will purchase. I'm sure one can does not cost that much. Thank you, Iva Jeane Driggers"
"I think it was a very good book, especially if you are interested in Indian crafts or building a bow and arrow."
"I almost didn't buy this album after hearing some of the two star reviews from the others, but I took a chance on it, and I give it 4 stars. ""Put It Where You Want It"" is excellent, both in track one and the jamming version on track 11, and ""Roll With It"" is also excellent. There's no question that it's hard to beat some of Larry's finest songs. My personal favorite is ""Smiles and Smiles to Go"" and it's hard to beat his old album ""Discovery"". But if you're a Larry Carlton fan, I think 4 stars is about right for this one."
"Golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone. I do agree on this theme becuase I don't think everyone is ""good"". I believe everyone does something that is evil. Although, some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence, which in my opinion, only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things, like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book, I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent."
Got it as a gift for one who loves this writer. He enjoyed it very much.
I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
"Sam's Letters to Jennifer is one of those stories where you laugh, you cry, you make a fool of yourself. Jennifer is probably one of Patterson's most likable characters. Even though, there were times when the book kind of reminded me of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (very few), I was pleasantly suprised. It has a very happy and at the same time very heartbreaking ending. Their is a great mystery and it keeps you guessing until the very end. All in all it is very vintage Patterson. Fast paced and great story."
"My family has a history of Dyslexia, so comic books are hard to read. So when my mother told me that had a Christmas Carol, Batman classic for sale, I was thrilled. Needless to say, there was no Batman and I wasted my time and money wondering when we were going to see the caped crusader kicking ebeneezers arse."
"This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""brick"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better."
My fault. I received it OK but it just doesn't work on my water heater. I must not have checked it enough. It was a bad impulse buy for me.
"If you like Jane Fonda or Vannassa Redgrave you'll like this movie.The content is dark but considering it's WWII that won't be a surprise. The movie is touching,sad,and in someways makes you feel nice about love and friendship and in another way makes us wonder how far we'd go in the name of friendship."
"I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray, but the DVD of ""Otis"" has a ton of great extras (commentary, deleted/alternate scenes/ending, featurette, trailers, etc.). This version, however, has no extras whatsoever. I thought the point of Blu Ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality.On the plus side, ""Dr. Giggles"" has never looked better, and this seems to be the only Blu Ray release of that film. Though it's weird that they've paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly 20 years later.If you're only interested in the films themselves, you can't beat the price. But the lack of extras is irksome."
it's less than 20 bucks....so don't go spending anymore than that in this wonderful economy we have!!Cheers..Tony(NYC)
"I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader, but usually I don't enjoy books of this nature, opting for fantasy and sci-fi escapism instead. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the Forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot! I know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more ""Adventure! Action!"" type books, but there is no lack of excitement here!"
Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before
"After the massive success of Clay Aiken's first single, ""This is the Night"", the expectations were high for his debut album. Luckily, Aiken does not disappoint. From the catchy, up-tempo single ""Invisible"" to the touching and emotive title track, ""Measure of a Man"", this cd provides a fantastic balance of lyrical depth and impressive vocal range. While some think his powerful voice is better suited for Broadway, this impeccable debut cd proves that Clay has the capability of being a phenomenal recording artist. In an industry full of sell-outs and talentless clones, it's refreshing to experience an artist as gifted and genuine as Clay Aiken."
I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD since I first got a DVD player about three years ago. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as a man falsely accused of murder trying to find his wife's killer. The plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense. Definitely a must-have.
"When I was about four or five years old I loved to watch The Last Unicorn. Spotting it at Blockbuster, I decided to rent it, wondering how I would see it now.I was worried when I saw that the animation was Rankin/Bass, but in the end I found it to be a visual confection.Some of the characters do look a little cheesy, but most of the time the animation dazzled me. In particular Mommy Fortuna's tree stump hat is very cool, forestscapes are ethereal, and I love Molly's BIG brown eyes.My favorite scene is the meeting of Molly and the Unicorn...The woman is angered that the Unicorn came to her at a low point in her life rather than when she was ""new and innocent."" After that schpiel Molly embraces her and whispers, ""I forgive you.""To my mind, this is one of those works like The Little Prince or The Mouse and His Child that is meant for chidren but is sincere enough to captivate adults as well. Well done."
"Well worth the money. There are 25 minutes of deleted scenes, but the best part is the 7 minutes set to music of unused footage. You'll see why. I don't want to spoil it for you."
Terrible product. Switch malfunctioned after just a few months and I could not find a replacement. Avoid purchasing this model if you expect long term use and reliability. I have had a number of flashlights in the past and this one really lowered my expectations.
Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper! It is not deep enought to fit 12X12 paper. Don't make the same mistake I did!
"So far I really like it. It's very informative and useful. I would have given 5 stars but I have it on Kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper. It's difficult to ""flip through the book"" and find what you need. But I am fairly new to Kindle so maybe it's just me. Or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand. But I do recommend it in whichever form you prefer."
"I don't have to hear only new music all the time, but I must say that Oasis' ""Be Here Now"" is one album I'd just as soon forget forever. If ""What's the Story Morning Glory"" defined and popularized Brit-pop, ""Be Here Now"" sounded its death knell! I will admit that the sound is much like older Oasis recordings, but that's just the problem. It's TOO much like the older stuff and sounds suspiciously like the Gallaghers were in a hurry to turn out something - anything - a.s.a.p. What makes this album so bad is that it was hyped SO much, which left this Oasis fan with a sharp sense of being taken for a ride. Oasis may be the most popular British band, but they aren't the best. Much British talent goes unnoticed overseas (i.e. Silver Sun, the Dandys, Shed Seven, Catatonia, Northern Uproar), and that's a shame! Save your money for something more original than ""Be Here Now."""
"This has to be one of the finest of the Hammer collection. Lee is piercing in his role as the Duc De Richelieu. There are occultists galore and it's up to Lee and his pal to save the son of a friend and his lover from the eternal grip of the creepiest villan Hammer studios ever unleashed. You must see this movie in widescreen! The visual created by director Terrence Fisher, of the English countryside, will give you a warm fuzzy until the final clash between good and evil."
"Moby is more than a genius of techno, he is a genius of music. What he does in this album is so joyful and depressing simultaneously, I just want to listen to it over and over again. The best tracks are Porcelain, Why does my heart feel so bad?, Southside, Natural Blues, and Run On. And the rest are still amazing songs."
"When I first heard about this book, I wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation. Fortunately, a continuation.I had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock, I bought it. I read it in 4 days, reading each night after work. I can say it was a good read. Steady flowing action, no real dull moments, no unnecessary story lines, etc. I was not disappointed at all.I gave it only 4 stars, much for the same reason others have, the ending was rushed and abrupt. But, never fear, there is to be 3 more books before the real ending. So, we all have something to look forward to.This is only the second Koontz book I have read, so I was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing. More die hard Koontz fans may be able to tell the difference.So, overall a good, smooth, never dull, read. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist."
"Fortunately this book is currently out of print, and should stay that way. The illustrations and pictures throughout the book date back to the late fifties and sixties. No where in the book does MS Nichols discuss in any detail the finer points of actually showing your purebred dog. To her benefit she did a very good job of depicting what it is like to attend a dog show and how champions earn their pionts. Unfortunatly, most of this information is not laid out in any organized manner. At times I felt like I was having a friendly cup of coffee as she skipped from one thought to another. Her biggest inside tip under the chapter ""Tricks of the Trade"" was ""Keep your nose clean, your eyes and ears open, and your mouth closed until you know what it is all about."" Good advice since you won't learn what showing your own dog is about from this source."
"This is probably the worst CD Sawyer Brown has ever came out with. Out of the 11 songs, only about 4 are worth listening to. I recommend you listen to it before you waste any of your hard earned cash on this."
"Paid $300.00 for these about 5 years ago. After about 2 years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky, comes off on your fingers and gets on everything. The replacement ear pads don't fit into the frame well and come out easily. The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing. I found several over-the-ear clip ear phones for under $10.00 to be superior in every way, including comfort, quality stereo, and I can use these cheaper ear phones when I'm sweating/exercising: don't try that with the Bose headphones! The Bose headphones didn't really cancel ambient noise. I don't use them anymore."
I've been in a Disciple bible study class for 5 years and have seen others with this book; finally decided to order it for myself. It's a great resource and has good information that is factual and concise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Bible!
"Totally fun and captivating with creativty for children 3-13 plus lots of stuff for older brothers/sisters as well as Mon/Dad or any extended family member to partake in. Great pace for ALL. Perfect music and voice and a nice outdoor background lending itself to an uplifting and yet mellow mood.Everyone will be inspired to increase their mental/emotional calmness, physical coordination, flexibility as well as focus of mind alone and with friends/family."
"Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. ""12th rising"", ""brimstone gate"", but the songs off of Vittra all sound similar. I can't really decipher between them. Most of the riffs aren't capturing. It is hard to find the cd Diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already I can tell you that cd is better than Vittra."
"Bridgewater's theatrical experience definitely works against her on this CD. The vocal posturing annoys and distracts. Her material is excellent, and her band really cooks. Drop the coy mannerisms and just sing, Dee Dee."
This is with out a doubt the most beatifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns ever published. Every page is a visual & mystical treasure.I reccomend it to any & all seekers of light on the subject of Unicorns.
"Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell, I have heard many more clever jokes and ""one-liners"" watching King of Queens on cable.....SERIOUSLY FOLKS, it's THAT BAD....the bad jokes and the 23 references to small jewish penises got old real quick. Thought i would always be a Sandler fan but he clearly, Adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and RAN!Why else would the plot line include Seth Rogan writing for him??? To put things into perspective, this film made Bruno look like Casablanca!!"
"Just think of all the trees cut down to make all the additions of this classicly boring novel. This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself. The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them . Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse."
"My recent purchase of ""Quest for fire"" from Amazon.com was a great experience. The DVD arrived on time and in very good condition. The film was a joy to see again. the screening went very well, as the movie was very clear with great sound. I highly recommend Amazon.com for your next DVD purchase."
"Easy to set up. Big enough for several kids to play in. Does take up a lot of room. Just be careful with the rods when setting it up. We did get a tear. Overall, the kids have fun playing with it. It's a good play tent for several kids and older kids as well."
The batteries don't last very long and the train has stopped working after a year of minimal use. It still makes the sounds but no longer moves. I love the train but would never spend this much again.
"I really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable. There is a good range of tunes, which fit together well as a whole. I think I listened to it about 6 times in a row when I first got it."
How this got printed I dont know. Wish I could have seen samples of the tutorials before I purchased online. (...)
"Surely, dear reader, this book must be a parody of Austen and Trollope. But one turns the pages with an uneasy consciousness that one has not been let in on the joke."
"I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-""Growin up, Brewin UpGuerilla gettin trained uplook out look outFrom over the Rooftop"" [reffering to LTTE snipers]""Competition coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop""She has a lot of LTTE propaganda in her music website, and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music. She needs to get a grip, and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they're buying here."
"If anyone else but Marlene Dietrich had played the lead in this film, the film would have been awful! Dietrich triumphs in a role no-one would have predicted. mysterious, mesmerizing, seductive, funny, and finally moving as the loyal gypsy(!) Lyddia, Dietrich makes you overlook the films flaws. At times the film drags by, some supporting players seem to have cotton in their mouths as they speak, and some of the dialogue is inane. Through it all, Dietrich is the soul of this movie, holding it all together in spite of the flaws, to make the whole thing work. Worth watching as a romantic piece of Hollywood escapism, and for seeing Dietrich as the fine actress she is."
"I found this book to be very informative and easy to understand. I had been looking for sometime, for any information reguarding the chevrolet inline six cylinders, 250 and 292. It really help me with the knowledge and unstanding of this inline six cylinder motor, that i find to be very inpressive and highly underated by most small block V-8 chevy motor heads. I just wish I could have found this book long before I finished building my motor. But that's ok, I already have plans for the next motor and I will be refering to this book when building torque and horsepower."
"Orwell's futuristic 1984 was a pleasure to read. The detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest Winston and Julia. The paper weight symbolizes the end of Winston and Julia's private and secure existence, which allow them to be safe with each other. They found refuge in the small apartment where they could be themselves without ""Big Brother"" watching their every move, it's ironic the government was still able to scrutinize every moment of their lives. I enjoyed reading this novel. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Orwell."
"It's great to finally see this album released on CD. I've wanted this for a long time. Hot on the heels of the ""Biggest Prize in Sport"" album, this was released by Polydor in the USA clearly with the idea of riding the cresting new wave. Sure, it was probably 999's most ""commercial"" album but listeners are treated to some great catchy hard rockin' songs. No, it's not punk but these guys never were really prime safety pin disciples. A very consistent album. Sing along! And what a great live band they were!"
very creative and well-made thriller.it is surprising viewers.when u leave cinema(or closes dvd/video/vcd)u are thinking it is worth paying 2 $(or renting or buying).for third dimension flick-buffs.
"These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8"" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for."
"Usher's ""8701"" is one of the best R&B albums I have EVER purchased. EVERY SONG on this album is beautiful. I always like Usher but with this album.....I'ma die-hard fan! He does a great job balancing the up tempo songs and the ballads. The fast tracks make you wanna get up and dance and the slow ones make you wanna cry and just call that special someone in your life and just tell them ""I love you"". His voice is excellent on every track and most importantly.....the man lets you know what love is about. The jewels on this album are ""U remind me"", ""U got it bad"", ""Twork it out"", ""Can u help me"", ""If I want to"", ""Good ol' Ghetto"" and ""TTP"" (lol, basically every track on the album!). On a last note....those of you who know what good R&B music is, this album is a must, TRUST ME!!!"
People of all ages love this story. It is currently a movie and a book and both are equally fantastic. The Last Unicorn has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remeber. This movie will never leave you stranded. It has all the elements a fantasy story should have. Buy it while you can because this movie will remain for years to come and the longer you wait the more expensive it will be. This movie is a true classic.
"If you are a woman who has no life outside of whatever man you are trying to pursue, then this is the book for you.This book pretty much tells women to pretend to have a life outside of your boyfriend or lover, only then will he realize how truly amazing you are.Only then will the man will try to pursue you and feel like he is winning you over, you alpha female you!Man's thoughts: ""Gosh, she has friends that she goes to the mall with on Saturdays and yoga in the evenings on weekdays, she's such a busy and important lady. She doesn't need a man in her life, that's why I like her.""For all women out there, I know finding the right person is tough.But please stop caring so much about having a relationship with a man.Find your own happiness within yourself.You don't need to read this book to tell you to go out and have a life!!!!!!"
"This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth."
"The Braggs have so much solid time-proven info for optimal health!Each one is jam-packed with valuable self-care info, which in my opinion,is the best and only way to go. Between this and my Naturopath, I'm in great shape.No unnecessary drugs and surgeries for me!"
This is the first of Steve Berry's books that I've read. I liked it so much that I bought all the novels by him that I could lay my hands on (from my favorite local used books store). It is action packed and well researched. I admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched. His depiction of the Vatican's intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though (except perhaps for the murder parts). It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation.
"When a movie has dialogue like, ""I thought your ninja was supposed to take care of RoboCop!"", it ain't gonna be Citizen Kane. It won't even be a good RoboCop movie. But if you must indulge, look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies. Yes, I said look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies."
a movie that sneaks up on you. not a big budget. but an excellent film.and i like excellent films.
"Remnick won the Pulitzer for this unwrapping of 70 plus years of communist control of a collection of nations. In depth, he discusses the purges, the environment and events that allowed them to occur, the Russian view of the Patriotic War (WWII), the rise and fall of communism. Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I've met many of them. This book also gives the reader an understanding of the world in which they grew up. A world where Stalin was (literally) God. A world without independent thought. Fascinating, heart wrenching. Very readable."
"I purchased this book for my husband who worked for a couple of weeks in Trinidad. He was not able to buy a cookbook while there.I searched Amazon and bought the one and only Trindad cookbook, and it was a winner! He was very pleased that the recipes were for a lot of the food that he experienced."
"I've been a bibliophile since I was about six years old, and this is the first and only book that I have ever thrown onto the floor in disgust. From the poor orphaned farm boy who gets swept up into an exciting adventure, to the completely predictable dragons, dwarves and elves, to the Star Wars-esque evil empire and resitance movement, to the appearance of the white bearded wizardly mentor (tm), it seems as if every single stale fantasy cliche gets trotted out and pressed into service. This is a book composed of stock characters and overused plot points in an entirely typical and unimaginative pseudo-medieval fantasy setting. Anyone looking for a good YA fantasy novel would probably be better off with something by Diana Wynne Jones, Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, Phillip Pullman, J.K. Rowling, Holly Black, Monica Furlong, Susan Cooper, or any of the many other writers out there who have come up with vastly better books for younger fantasy fans."
The wrist weight are one size that may be used by a very tiny and thin adult of 100 lbs or a child. I could not get them over my hand to my wrist. The advertising should say what size the hand needs to be and to use them.
"This is very interesting film that is really five stories in one. A dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another. A great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time. The film is ultimately sad and depressing, but each story is very interesting. With a cast featuring Toni Collette, Giovanni Ribisi, Piper Laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong?"
"What a movie! What a cast! David Cronenberg took King's classic tale of precognition and predestination and gave it his own personal bleak touch! Christopher Walken (Sleepy Hollow) is the perfect Johnny Smith, taken out of normality and plunged into a psychic nightmare world. His gift / curse enables him to see both past and future events, leading him ever closer to his final destiny. Martin Sheen (The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane) is excellent as the lizard-like senate candidate, Greg Stillson. Horror mistress, Brooke Adams (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Shock Waves, Sometimes They Come Back) is Johnny's could / should-have-been ""wife"", unable to shake Johnny from her mind. Tom Skerritt (Alien) is the sheriff of Castlerock who seeks out Johnny in order to catch the infamous Castlerock killer. Herbert Lom (Asylum) is Johnny's doctor. Even Anthony Zerbe (The Omega Man) and Colleen Dewhurst (When A Stranger Calls) are along for this wild ride! Highly recommended..."
"I liked this movie, not because it was a break from the originals but because it was what defined the series. Most people who criticize this movie obviously did not watch it several times over to get the whole point of it! The first 2 movies never truly explained what the curse of Michael Myers was and how it came about! Nor did they emphasize on the history of Samhain like this one did! This movie attempts to explain that and Halloween 6 (Curse Of Micheal Myers) finishes it up! Try to read more into a movie, people, and not be so quick to judge!"
WHY DID SHE FEEL THE NEED TO KNOCK REPUBLICANS AT EVERY TURN? A REAL SIGN OF LOW INTELLIGENCE. SPOILED BOOK COMPLETELY. SHE IS VERY OPINIONATED IN ALL HER THOUGHTS AND FILTHY TALK TO BOOT...THINKS SHE IS SOPHISTICATED...BAH.BAD BOOK.
"""Be Here Now"" does have its moments (""D'You Know What I Mean"", ""My Big Mouth"", ""Stand By Me"", and ""Don't Go Away"") along with a few lesser tracks (""All Around The World"" and ""It's Getting Better Man"") and a true dog (""Magic Pie""), but it's just another example of what happens when you're worth $40,000,000, the cocaine supply is never-ending (Noel Gallagher has admitted this and stopped using), and you ask how long a CD is (74 minutes) and you say, ""Well, let's fill the <expletive> up"".The production is awful. Knobs-up, full stop. Layers and layers of squalling guitars. All hints of subtleness are gone except for the end part of ""Don't Go Away"". The band still rocks out, but the sound is harsh.I almost gave it three stars because of the decent songs on here, but I've got to deduct one star for the ""Phil Spector with hearing damage"" style of production. Sorry guys. Find a better producer next time out."
"I enjoyed all but one of the 11 stories in this book from 1927 to 2002. Even though I didn't enjoy Pamela Zoline's ""The Heat Death of the Universe"" I can see why it is an important story to include in this collection of some of the science fiction that can be seen as feminist. ""seen as feminist"" here is the key I think especially when you look at the essays paired with each story. A few of the essays were spot on -- looked at the author and the story in their historical context. Others rambled between sharing previous scholarship and trying to find multiple readings of the material one of which was a feminist interpretation. The 11 stories are intense and moving, challenging the reader while entertaining. I loved that they were organized chronologically because I could see a flow and development of the feminist voice. I wish a concluding essay had tied them all together to bring this out more."
"I was very disappointed with this....I realize it is a 1950 film, however, the sound and picture were off much if not all of the film. Additionally, it wasn't listed as a DVD-R, but is. Wish it had been a better quality production with sound and picture in sync as I really wanted it for my collection."
"Honestly, this book is one of the best I have ever read.(I have read a lot of books). Its plot, characterization and flawless storytelling make for one compelling read."
I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring. I was happy with the price and that's about it.
"This was very amateurish. Don't think it would hold even the attnetion of a child, no matter what age."
I will start off by saying I have not personally played this game. I don't really like chess so am not super excited to play. But my son really wanted this for Christmas. I was a little leary of getting it because we have had laser games that didn't work very well in the past and ended up being a waste of money. But there wasn't much he wanted for Christmas and the reviews on Amazon were good so I got it for him.He loves it! Him and my boyfriend have played numerous times since Christmas and they are both addicted to it. My boyfriend keeps begging me to play it with him when my son isn't around. The lasers are very strong and neither of them have complained about having any issue with it working.It also seems to be very fast play. I don't think it takes them more than 20 minutes to finish a game.And I love the fact that it isn't something that has to be plugged into a TV to play and it makes you think and strategize.
i bought this 18 months ago. i purchased a refurb unitwell about 2 months ago the ps started to act up.$90.00 later it's working again. Many people have experienced this problem with the ps
The book wasn't as great as the reviews said it was. The explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didn't have the detail I expected (e.g. AWT). It's probably a better book if you already know Java and are looking to catch some of the finer points. I don't recommend it for absolute beginners.
"I have seen this movie at least 40 times, and it just gets better everytime. Kubrick does an excellent job of adapting Burgess's book to the big screen. Excellent directing and acting make this a must see. It is a bit harsh, but if viewed as a whole, the movie makes a strong point about how far we can go, when trying to rehabilitate the criminal mind. I also recommend reading the book after watching the movie, it has more detail and a different ending."
"This book reminds me of algebra, its boring, time-consuming, worthless, and you will never have to use this in your whole life. Never! So when you're teacher asks you to read this book, don't do it. Read the Cliff Notes or watch the Wishbone version."
the story line is perfect the cast and choreogophy are great but the dvd's suck out of the first 20 chapters only 5 have had no problems and i lost have of the story line
When I bought this and took it home. I played it and was severely dissapointd. Ditto to what most other reviewers said. I took it back to Best Buy the next day. It sucks!
I was very pleased at how quickly I received my purchase. It was for a gift and I tend to be a procrastinator at getting things.
I really liked this book. The characters were intersting and the relationship Sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother. The book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the 20's and 30's.
"This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book, she was extremely irritating. Brodick was also another irritating character, I mean like some kind of wild caveman. I Liked Gillian and Ramsey and think they would have made a better couple. This is her first book where I think she overwrote the male lead. This is the first book I've read by JG that I wasn't crazy about but Gillian, Ramsey, Ian and Judith made up for the shortcoming with this one."
"This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators, I would be forced to take the stairs. I hope by the next release Clay has the music to complement his voice."
"this was a good book. the part called ""coca""is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like ""the giver"" only a lot better."
I think everybody should read this who likes existentialism. it is a very quick read though. i think it would make a very great movie.
"Although I am very happy with the other NetGear products I own I have to say that this adapter is a waste of money. It's easy to set up (I'm running Windows 2000) and starts working at first, but after less than a half hour, it flickers out and stops working entirely.I have a NetGear router and laptops using NetGear PCI wireless cards which work well, but this product is a dog. I second one of the earlier reviewers who mentioned how hot the item gets after a short time in use. My guess is that it has a design flaw that causes it to overheat and stop working. They should really go back to the drawing board on this one."
"Inflates like a charm, then deflates under the weight of a child within 3-6 hours, I should have gone with my gut and purchased another Aerobed because the one I already have (queen) has worked for > 7 years."
This is a great kettle with one serious flaw. My kettle has started rusting inside the spout after 1 year. There is a lip where the spout joins the base and water is caught there after use.
"For a 1/2"" slip-mount installation, this diverter spout is not worth the trouble.You must unscrew the diverter's plastic nipple, remove a plastic adapter, slide it on the copper pipe, screw the plastic nipple back on, tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic, slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall, tighten the screw, and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape. That seems straightforward, but in practice it's very difficult.The problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit 1/2"" copper pipes longer than about 1"" from the wall. The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2-3/4"" long, but actually this is wrong. At first I struggled with trying to install it, then broke the plastic when I could not force it to go all the way in.I elected instead to go withMoen 3808BN Kingsley Slip Fit Tub Diverter Spout, Brushed Nickel, which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw, with almost no effort."
"I don't get what people like about this book. Lindsey is a fluid writer, good describer, but his characters spend way too much time in their own heads and the action, in this book at least, is predictable and rendered downright boring. All the lurid details that are supposed to add to the ""psychoerotic"" nature of the book come off as crude and off-putting instead, like a geek at a sideshow biting the head off a chicken. And anyone who can't guess the ""surprise twist"" by page 25 wasn't reading very closely."
"This is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like. However if your boyfriend doesn't like these types of movies then put in the ""unrated version."" In the regular version the kissing/sex scene doesn't show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy. It's definitely a cutesy movie, but the eye candy and bar scenes will keep the guys watching. Piper Perabo and the rest of the girls won't disappoint I promise!"
"This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned."
The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin. There should be a warning on the tag but there isn't. If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this. In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic. This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout.
"In my opinion, no movie does any book justice. The book version is always better. This one is not a great remake of the book. I bought another version that was better. Would not highly recommend."
"Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating just a little. Maybe it didn't exactly take my breath away, but it is an incredible DVD. This is a real good movie, however ""not exactly a phenomenon"" as Steven Speilberg claims in a brief interview on the DVD. The DVD in itself with all the extra bonus materials is outstanding. I found it to be very informative and very interesting to see how this movie was made and just how much dedication and extremely hard work it took just to get all the years-worth animation included with the live-action, get it produced, make countless sketches, and finally get it out to the theaters. Well done. Very well done. I couldn't be more pleased and more impressed with this special DVD release. It's definitely a must-have."
"Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that's all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 ""generations"" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS."
"This version of ""Beowulf"" should NOT be compared, at all, to the original text of ""Beowulf"". Students should not be taught that THIS story, as re-created by Robert Nye, is reflective of the ""Beowulf"" written about 1000 AD. The story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by Christian concepts and ideals. This version, written by Robert Nye, reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history, de-Christianizing it as they go along. Robert Nye has replaced the Christian God of the original ""Beowulf"" with the mythological Viking god ""Odin"". The original ""Beowulf"" tale supports the historical significance that Christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of England and throughout Europe. Robert Nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions, or lack thereof."
"As fun to read as to watch! While not the true Christmas story, it certainly captures the spirit of Christmas and the effects of living one's Christmas faith in the incarnate Lord Jesus."
Do not bother! Cena does not have the potential of the Rock or even Kane for that matter. They are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan!
"I rather liked ""Dune"" but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful! When i closed the book I couldn't even remember what it was all about. So unless you are a great fan of Frank Herbert or intend to read the entire series, don't bother."
"This movie personifies everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days. The characters are superficial, the plot anemic, and the special effects vastly overused. Liam Neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction. The house is possessed by the spirit of its builder, who hates kids. That is about it. A terrible remake of the original 1963 classic, which was the best horror film ever made. Get the original, and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot."
This final installment of an otherwise brilliant trilogy on the Anne of Green Gables story is beyond horrific. It is a stain on the memory of Lucy Maude Montgomery.
"I looked forward to reading yet another Meg Wolitzer novel, and I was very disappointed--in fact, I lost interest early on and never finished it. Some of the author's earlier works, such as Sleepwalking and Hidden Pictures, were excellent--what happened???"
"This book brings you into a thinking mode while entertaining you.A capable man who can make practical reality based decisions whodeclines to take control or make things happen in his personal life. A man who reacts rather than acts, through most of his life. It is also introspective of a man's view on loss. I truly felt this was a thinking feeling person's book. All the more remarkable for a first novel writer. even though an experienced writer. Looking forward to the next book from this writer who shows a brilliant future. Entertaining, emotional, and educational, what a combination!Patt Gronick"
"When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down, it just wasn't grabbing my attention, but once I got further into the book my curiosity got the best of me. I couldn't put the book down. I could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did. Adrian Jenkins was confused and deceitful. All hell does break loose. Gregory's relationship with his mother was sad. I understand her point for leaving but at the same time it was selfish. It not only destroyed Gregory but it also destroyed his little sister. I am definately looking forward to her next book."
"Given my odd sense of humor, I wasn't suprised that I liked this book. While tragic, the deaths accounted for remind us that when we're dealing with nature, we must deal with it on its own rules. The ""pedestrians have the right-of-way"" attitude won't cut it out there, folks! Of course some deaths were not the result of the individuals foolishness, but also by accident or bad luck."
"Fast shipment, easy to find what I wanted. It was a gift for my daughter. Just what I ordered.....used but in very good condition. My daughter was very happy!"
"I had never read or even heard of the book so I was able to approach this movie with no bias at all. I found the movie to be pleasant and enjoyable. The roles were all convincingly played and I found myself really mad at the Scott Wilson character, Judd Travers; Wilson did a great job at being a despicable villain. The other major and supporting roles are well cast and played by seasoned actors and actresses which contribute to the overall ambience of the movie.Blake Heron plays the part of Marty Preston, our stories hero, and is convincing as the young lad who falls in love with a dog. The dog is in trouble and turns to Marty for help; Marty reacts to the need and decides the dog is his responsibility. That decision is the beginning of Marty's time of testing that will lead to an ending that won't disappoint.This is a first class family movie and one the entire family will enjoy."
"I've had a variety of netgear products over the last 3-4 years. I've generally been pleased w/features and functionality.Up until recently I've never had to draw on netgear tech support. However, after a year of working fine one of my firewall/routers went ""kerplunk."" All the signs point to a hardware problem. So I contacted tech support realizing that I'd have to go through the usual rigamorole (sp?) to get an RMA.However, despite a very detailed email description of the problems and the various things I did to try and fix them (firmware upgrades/reinstalls, hardware resets, etc) the tech who answered me told me I'd have to contact them through telephone support.Currently (11:10 PM Eastern Time, 29 July 2003) wait times for tech support are in excess of 140 minutes! That's unacceptable.If you are lucky enough to never need tech support, or to have an item repaired/replaced then netgear is a fine option. Otherwise, buyer beware!"
"Normally I am the kind of person who goes for books with adventure and fantasy in them. But hey, I tried this one out and loved it. It's not as fast paced as some of the books I've read, but that suprisingly didn't matter. I suggest anyone read it."
"i loved the original poster i lost due to a move, i decieded to replace it and ordered this poster but when i recieved it it was NOT black and white but black and blue."
"AS described, but I think you need to know some French before you can use this product effectively."
"I first started listening to Azucar Moreno through a friend in New York a long time ago... This is exciting music, and you don't have to understand Spanish to get into the party feeling of this music... flamenco, latin pop, whatever you want to call it. Every album seems to have one standout pop booty shaker... I think Tequila claims this title, but Besame is cool, and Tu Eres Para Mi is Funky Cool, and Hay Que Matar a la Muerte pops with energy."
"This is a marvelous book and an easy read. Even though Ben Franklin seemed to be just an average guy, as you read about him accomplishing one thing after another, you get a sense of his magnificence as a man.I wish I had read this book when I was a kid, perhaps a little of the diligence that is portrayed on every page would have rubbed off on me.The autobiography is amazing in a low key, Ben Franklin sort of way."
"I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6, I'm 5'4 and weigh 120lbs right now; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isn't much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress (I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips). I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6"" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last."
"Only buy this book if you want to feel your child is a loser, it's ALL your fault and there's nothing you can do about it, EVER! I'm not even going to pass this book on, it's going in the trash! That being said, there are some great kids social skills books out there: 1.) The unwritten rules of friendship 2.) Nobody likes me, everybody s me 3.) Good friends are hard to find"
My daughter requested these for Christmas. She watches them over and over. This is a good clean show for teenagers. Highly recommend.
Great photography and outstanding special effects. A move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation.
"Wonderfully written and hugely educational, taking the reader from the theory of historical evidence to the stories of King Richard III"
I love the simplee clean microfiber swivel mop. It is bigger and easier to use than the swiffer and you don't have to keep buying replacement sheets...just wash and go. A much more environmental and financial choice than other cleaning options.
"I decided to read this book after watching it on PBS. Of course there was more detail in the actual novel and Jane Austen never fails to ""dazzle you with her footwork"". The description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there."
"This thing needs a High Med Low setting cause the only setting it has is Low. I made a cup of really nice organic Japanese Shade grown tea ($40 an ounce) and asked my wife to bring me an ice cube to warm it up after it had been on the heater for 10 minutes. The pad gets pretty hot, but not near hot enough to keep a cup of coffee hot. After something has been sitting on it for about 10 - 15 minutes you can gulp it with no fear of getting burnt. A Worthless piece of Crap. I will see if it works as a candle warmer."
"Through a Narrow Gate is a testament to the personal struggle between feeling the faith and wanting to somehow live it, too. I am impressed with her ability to relive the experience while being fair to both sides and making their decisions and feelings make sense, even when they are directly opposing. The most remarkable thing is her feelings about the modern convents given her struggle and her respect for what was. Her respect is contagious - she gave it to me! She, and her experiences, seem to ratify my own even as mine pale against her story. I recommend it to anyone seriously trying to understand God in their own lives and in their own terms."
"I loved Oasis' first US album, What's The Story Morning Glory?, and this was a wonderful follow-up. The music is crisp, fresh, and has catchy melodies that keep you listening. I love Oasis and I love this CD!"
"There are less expensive diapers out there, but I found that Pampers and Huggies might be more money, but are the better diaper too. I also found that Baby Dry diapers were the least expensive of the diapers that work. I have a girl and they work great. I really don't even price check anymore. I just get these using amazon mom and subscribe and save and get them as cheap as I can. I lot easier shopping for diapers when you have your favorite, and these are definitely my favorite.Edit October 2012: I now have another baby girl. I decided to give luvs a try again, and like them this time around. I didn't like them with my first daughter. Not sure if my opinion changed or if luvs changed their diaper up. There is definitely a different feel than other brands, but after amazon mom ended I started shopping again and now I get luvs from sam's club."
"This is the first book from Candice Porter I have read and I cannot wait to begin reading her other novels. From the minute I read the first page, I knew that this book would be original and hard to put down. The characters are believable and Ms. Proctor's writing is so detailed that you feel you are there with them throughout the book. I would definitely recommend this book - you will not be sorry that you bought it!"
This album is by far one of the best underground albums I've ever heard. It is a very unique blend of Russian/gypsy style music and good ole rock'n'roll. The magic created by this Colorado band is a wonderful breath of fresh air in the mostly stagnant popular music scene of the last few years. I challange anyone to listen to this album and NOT be dancing their all over the place!
"The book is fantantic, with lots of information and figures.The only issue resides on the missing habilitie of the kindle touch to reproduce the authors voice on poems and music inside the book, this can only be done in Fire version or Kindle for Iphone or Ipad, not even on Kindle for PC. I really can't understand!"
"Typical ERB Mars series, which I find light reading. Not too much depth or thought provoking, but nice escape from everyday."
The entertainament quality is above the average of the series SG1. I think this film reached the quality level of Stargate Atlantis.
"THE CABLE IT'S NO SAME TO THE PHOTO, DO NOT HAVE A TERMINAL CIGARETTE CONNECTOR, I LOST MY MONEY. I think you wrong the part, I receive Part No. RB, have a wiring diagram for make a Gilsson RB cable for install a DB-9 serial connector, but no, I buy to you other cable whit 12 volt adapter cable."
"The filter works fine, and I was about to order another. I paid $5.75 for it 7 months ago, and now it is almost $30. I mean we all expect to pay a little more when we buy items later on, but more than 5 times as much?"
"This is an AMAZING CD! This mans voice is incredable. There is not one song that I dislike. I loved his performances on American Idol, but this CD shows more of what he can do. All you Clay fans are in for something GREAT! Can't say much more, buy it and see for yourself."
"If you are ready for a stark, unrelenting description of life in the ghetto, Auschwitz and Dachau, this book doesn't let up for one sentence. Amazing story and written in a way that is poetic but easy to read. The book is classified as fiction but it is really a memoir, with names changed. There is no way anyone could make this up."
"This is the worst book I've ever read because it was advertised as a THRILLER but there was zero suspense. It was such a boring book that it's a wonder that I even finished it. In contrast, I read the DA Vinci Code in 3 days because I simply couldn't put the book down.If the Last Juror had been advertised as a novel about a small Southern town, somewhat like To Kill A Mockingbird, I would have had a different mindset and probably would have enjoyed it more. I read Mockingbird in 3 days also."
No blood or guts... just wonderful characters showing what love really is ! Don't miss seeing this one if you haven't already. Great for Christmas!
"As philosophy of science this work is very fascinating. Unfortunately it is permeated with rather Marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish. But, as an incissive criticism of reductionist science, especially biology, it is very good."
"R kelly's carrer is full of contradictions. On one song he's singing about how good GOD is, then the next song he's Feeling on ya Boody. R kelly has so much potential to be a respectful artist. But if he continues on the corse he is now, the qualtiy of his character will continue to be decline along with his music."
"If you're a public radio fan wanting to know what Garrison Keillor is really like, or how angry Bob Edwards actually got when he exited Morning Edition unwillingly after almost 25 years as host, this is not the book for you. It is a highly readable, highly personal perspective on the philosophies and politics that shaped NPR and made public radio a force in American media. Those most apt to appreciate it are among the thousands of people who have been employed in public radio over the last 30 years -- including career veterans who will recognize the names and remember the events that Mitchell recalls."
"This over-priced pain in ""the sitting area"" has an always-on, glaring RED light.*Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW.*NO-I don't have a carbon Monoxide problem. The red light also stayed on for a week when I plugged it in to an outside plug."
This book is 500 pages long and I read it in 5 days. Putting the book down was impossible and I took it wherever I went. Even though the book is kind of a copy from LORD OF THE RINGS it still will get you hooked. I recommend this book for ages 11 to adult. Interesting turns are always happening to the characters. If you can live through the semi-boring first 40-50 pages you will love this book.
"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
"Well I got this CD for Christmas and I am extremely pleased with it. I think CD 1 which is more hard house than trance is the better - mainly for Florian F's Surreal Brazil which is a masterpiece - But still I like the harder feel of this disc. Number 2 is definitely lighter and trancier but gets a bit harder towards the end although it is spoiled at the start by using too many tracks with vocals(I think a definite no-no in trance), but even so there are some gems like Moogwai's Viola. So overall if you like stompier hard house tunes, buy it and listen to CD 1. CD 2 has too many cheesy vocals for me, so if you want good trance, wait for the soon-to-be-released Binary Finary album instead."
"Why not issue the extended edition (177 minutes) in a set with the theatrical release? A rip-off, as is so common."
"Oh, this series is so good! I am waiting impatiently for the 6th one to come out, and so i am reading all the other ones over and over again. And I've just learned that there is to be a new series of Warriors. All new characters and clans! Stone clan, sky clan, and some other ones I forgot. it's called Midnight and is coming out next year on March. I'm going to pre-order mine's now!"
"ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk, shelf, etc."
"If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as ""Teach Yourself Hindi"" does. The authors of that title, R.Snell & S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell & Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice."
Had this CD years ago and it was stolen from my car along with all other music. The CCM being played today can't hold a candle to this beautiful musical offering. Clay Crosse is amazing.
I was a little surprised by the content of this book. It is really not a book I would recommend. It is about a Grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right. Then it ends. I thought it could have been more meaningful.
This is really a great CD. Chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts. you just have to understand them.
IRVING STONE HAS HIS READERS RELIVE VINCENT VAN GOGH'S LIFE.AFTER READING THE BOOK YOU CAN EASILY APPRECIATE THE TUMULTOUS LIFE THIS ARTIST HAD.THE AURTHOR HAS USED CERTAIN FICTIONAL MOMENTS AS HE AGREES TO IN THE END.THESE ONLY MAKE THE BOOK MORE READWORTHY.THE EMPHASIS IN THIS BOOK IS ON THE LIFE OF VINCENT VAN GOGH IN RELATION TO THE ART HE PRODUCED.ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVOURITES.
love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
"Yepp 700H is nice looking but apparently only works with iTunes 1.1 or 1.2 on the Mac platform. iTunes is on 3.0 with 2.0.4 being the last working version that ships with Apple products. It is useless to say Mac compatible.On a PC, the unit caused my computer to crash and repairs to software loads needed to be done to recover. So I was not able to get satisfaction via that route either.May be a good idea to just ...go- and get a iPod for Mac or PC.The buttons on the Yepp are difficult to use unless you have tiny fingers, the rocker switch slips and it's easy to depress the play function while rocking, confusing your input. The remote is cool though. The FM Tuner worked medium-well."
"I used these to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cake. I have to admit, they were a bigger hit than my cake! lol!"
"im writing this review from my n800 nice device, a lot of app, nokia releases a new os evry 2 months, i liked it!"
"Steve Berry is one of those writers you love to read - from the get-go you are part of the ride. Each one of his works is a given that it will entertain, and get you thinking.Secret deals with the message the Holy Virgin gave to the children at Fatima -Has some of the grace of Angels and Demons, but not the wild ride of an ending, although a satisfactory one.Definitely worth reading."
My dog ate this book the first day we left her alone in the same room with it. Seriously.
"In ""The Greengage Summer"" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended."
"The book does not live up to Traditional Home's reputation of quality work. Frankly, I can find better photos and design insite from magazines than what I found in this book. It's easy to understand why there are so many people wanting to sell the copies they have. It is honestly a disppointment if you are used to truly inspiring design publications. If you decide to buy this book, do yourself a favor and purchase a used copy. Even at Amazon's reduced price it's still over priced for what you get."
It has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni. Good addition for a quick nutritional meal. It does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste.
they show this on PBS sometimes so even if you choose not to purchase the best drama ever to grace the 21 inch screen you can still see it. it is so far above anything else to first appear on television you may wonder how it ever was produced! perhaps that is a story in of itself. in any case it is truly one of a kind and to not see it would be like never seeing Dr. Zhivago or Casablanca or any of the other larger than life tragic love stories of this century.
"The reviews were great on this products, that is why I bought it.But when received mine in the mail and tried it out, It was completely useless, I think the worst 10 Dollars I have ever spent.It would not grip any hair of mine, the quality felt very poor, I had better experiences with tweezers from Walmart.Really disappointed."
"In an Age of Communist Oppression, we see a side of Daniel Day-Lewis reminiscent of the lovable letch 'Newland' in The Age of Innocence. Daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in Prague, who cannot tolerate oppression-OR resist women, and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable. It's amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage NOT to kill each other-as they pussyfoot around the painful truth. Lena Olin (Sabina) is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat-and one can easily love as well as hate her, as she tries to deceive the ever wise Tereza Tomas' wife (Juliette Binoche). Thumbs up to Tereza who acknowledges what Tomas cannot- as she forces him to face his weakness-and their love provides a measure of redemption. Still, it's Tomas' decision to return to Prague that results in terrible consequences. If not for the needless eroticism, this would have been a 5 star movie."
"this is a very fun boat overall. it isn't very fast, but it has great range and it's batteries last a long time. the only problem with the battery system is that it takes 6 AA batteries and u keep having to get new ones. I also recommend bringing it to a place with no waves so the boat doesn't tip. Overall, this is a very good boat for its price and especially good for younger children."
"The plot and acting for this movie are terrible. The conclusion doesn't make any sense. I watched this movie because of the positive reviews. After watching the movie, I wonder if the positive reviewers were paid to review this movie. It is very frusterating to watch because the main character continues to make the same mistakes over and over again. The ending brings no closure. Spoiler: The beginning is the ending and the ending is the beginning. I suppose the writer thought it would be witty but it is just a ridiculous plot."
Bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the reviews online; book is almost totally unreadable as it takes even the most simple pieces of code and over complicates them to the point where you just end up closing the cover and say what a waste of money.
"Probably the funniest movie about corporate America that I have EVER seen. From disgruntled employees to annoying co-workers, this movie has it all. A definate buy. If you enjoy movies like Caddy Shack and Princess Bride, you will love this."
"It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful."
If I could give this a half star I would. I bought this for my children to watch and I felt with a rated G rating that I was safe. How wrong I was. I am ashamed to say that I let my children see this before I did. When the magician is tied to the tree and his magic brings the tree to life all I see is the tree and her huge breasts. And the magician is stuck between her cleavage. The world is getting sick enough that I don't need to show a cartoon to my children with this garbage in it. I am highly disappointed and so are my children because they cannot watch this movie. I think that you need to watch this movie first before showing small children.
This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
Loved this product for my baby. I have enough diapers for her and they work so well controlling her during the night.
"I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old, maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated. However, my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental. Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal, they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother. If you want helpful, non-opinionated advice, this is not the book for you. Currently I'm reading ""The Working Mother's Guide to Life"" which seems much more friendly and helpful."
"Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices, speakers and headphones, and all have the same result, static. Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved. Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $3 shipped to begin with."
"This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts, I had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos. I recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy."
"Pearl Jam died, and this was the nail in the coffin. Gone are the furious beats of Vs, the melodic enchant of Ten, and the pure grunge soul of Vitalogy. All I hear is a weak, tired band that has run out of fuel."
"LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! I have listened to this CD since it came out on 10/14/03---CLAY AIKEN has a magical voice that pulls you in. All the songs are good and the outstanding songs in my opinion are ""The Way"", ""Touch"" and ""When You Say You Love ME""....It is refreshing for an entertainer to have the morals and committments that Clay Aiken has!! I find myself singing along to the music--not that you want to hear me singing. God Bless Mr. Aiken in his future endeavors!! I for one have been thrilled with the music and will continue buying anything Mr. Aiken's releases. Go CLAY!!!!! Don't let the nasties get you down...there are a lot of fans that just want to hear you sing!!!!!!"
"This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing. If it had been released as an original movie with an original title, it would have worked. The special effects (though good) were too much for this movie to bare."
"I Think that Camille Keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up, what she does afterward to each of them is well deserved.Rape and nude scenes so please beware, this 8o's film was raw and has become a true classic in the vein of Charles Bronson's 10 to midnight. This is a classic, get it while you can."
"A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York, United StatesTo say that this is an informative easy read is to grossly understate thefacts. I have been a lifelong democrat...ok a liberal democrat. I alwaysjust assume that all of these guys are just Rush Limbaugh clones, allsinging from his hymnal. A friend of mine convinced me to read this book andI must admit...I have started to re-think some of my views. This guy stateshis opinion & gives you the FACTS to back it up...it's hard to dispute whathe says. I'm still a democrat (notice I left the ""d"" lower case), but nolonger consider myself a liberal...I can't believe it myself...READ THISBOOK!"
"This book has found a permanent spot in my home, namely, on my desk, where I do all my hobbies. It has loads of great ideas that I've already used. Can't wait for the author's next book --apparantly its a sourcebook on animal designs."
"If you think this is how a woman should act in a relationship, you have another thing coming. Athough I suggest to you that we neither want a meek woman but someone inbetween who can hold her own and still be a lady.Such a gross misrepresentation what a man wants..ugh."
"Shearling is the best slipper material I have ever tried, so I've owned a number of shearling slippers. The sole of these is not as cushy as others I've had, and they don't feel quite as snug (which makes slippers snuggly). Having a non-shearling outer sole, as these do, is key for any sort of durability. Not a bad buy at the price, but there's a little compromise."
This product worked exactly as I had hoped. I did not feel like I had to keep running to the bathroom. It was controlled and effective.
"Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short."
"It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down. Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer, and Great Expectations prooved it."
"This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents, which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overall.Save your dollar and look elsewhere."
"This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy, gassy, and spit up like crazy. Not only did I hate to see them screaming with discomfort, but it was the hardest day I've had yet as a new mom to twins. Yes, I said ""day."" I took MMP as directed for only one day. The babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply. I cut out the MMP and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again. I'm pretty sure it's the blessed thistle that caused the issues. I tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues, although not anywhere near the degree as with MMP. I hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted, but I didn't find anything about effects similar to my experience so I felt the need to share."
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this puzzle. Good chunky pieces that the little ones can handle and all tidies away into a great little case. Well worth the price and makes a great gift for toddlers learning their association and coordination.
"Been watching this show on DVD since I got it. It made me even make want to get season 8 in the store which I did. It's a great show, one of my fav shows"
I ADORE IT! I HAVE A SIZE 5 RING FINGER AND IT LOOKS GREAT ON. THIS RING CAN FOOL YOU THAT IT COULD BE REAL. THE METAL HAS NOT TARNISHED OR TURNED MY FINGER COLORS AND SO I FEEL IT WAS A GOOD BUY.
"this comes from an action fan, and this aint no action film i was expecting something to keep me excited and on the edge of my seat. no way. there are like 4 fighting scences, and admitedlly these are very good but that does not lift the whole film, the dialogue in between these fight scences is laughable, i went to sleep 4 times in the cinema. now some people might like borin ""chat"" but i dont if a film is goin be based on the talking it should at least be well written like shawshank redemtion but this is borin i repeat borin borin borin. i know a lot of people will disagree with this but then maybe they werent expecting an action fest like it billed. so if u like boring chatter (a lot of) and a fighting (not much of) then buy this but i personally would not buy it. the end of my rant :)"
This book was very boring. very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between. The beginning of the book is the best part. It spent too much time explaining and describing images; i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers
Great horror movie! Jeffrey Combs does very well in this one
"This package is definately worth the price. I got it for my palm and couldn't stop playing it. If you are ever bored in meetings or just sitting around the house, this is a great way to have some fun. Me and my kids love it. It is just like the shooting games at the arcade. I would definately recommend it. If you liked this one I would also recommend the 100 great games for the palm."
"I may have enjoyed this album, had i been 14 years old or deaf. Strangely enough i listen to new and old metal but there is somethin about this band i dont like, #1 his voice is very annoying from the get go, where are they going with this garbage.Its been awhile since weve seen some fresh new metal/music that is decent and i have a feeling something is coming cause if it isnt,i dont think this genre will be pop much longer."
"The true title that Darwin gave this thesis is: ""On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."" Amazon.com makes no mention of this. Darwin believed that the peoples of Africa were inferior."
"Target diapers are much better than these diapers. My daughter sleeps through the night. When she wakes up her dress, the sheet everything will be wet. This diaper is ok to use during the day times but definitely not at night."
This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book...
"Second to NSYNC'S, ""Celebrity"", this CD is my favorite of all time! When you want to listen to 13 of 15 songs on a CD, you know it's good! This CD has an amazing balance of ballads and fast trax and rap. And the ballads are INCREDIBLE! ""U Got It Bad"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. I would DEFINITELY recommend that anyone a fan of Pop, R&B or Rap to get this CD, YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
"Imagine action films were 30 minutes long. There would be no time for sub-plots or romantic involvements or ""No! You go on without me ..."". All there would be is car chases and explosions. Godwill's book is rather like that.I liked it.Forget the measured blend of theory, fact and example which is the style of O'Reilly's authors. This book cuts to the chase, and it works.You see, Tomcat is a servlet runner. It isn't that interesting or even the best of breed (Jetty is way better). Tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it, and Goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodies.Its a bit like a night tour of Naples on the back of an Italian cigarette smuggler's Vespa. Somehow, at the end, despite not having understood much, you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your own.Take it or leave it. That's just the kind of book it is."
"This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up, with tabbed pages. I am sure I will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses."
"Very informative and fun to listen to for someone of my generation. I had heard bits and pieces of the Yardbirds story, but never the complete picture."
"Even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers I still purchased it. It is pretty easy to set up, but once connected to my PC it had very inconsistent behavior.The device would lose connection to the server after a being idle for 1-2 hours and require a reset.The video performance was awful with the included software. Tversity freeware media server made video performance better, but fast forward and rewind wouldn't work do to some video conversion routines being run by Tversity.Music files would play, and sounded good, but navigating through my music selection was nearly impossible because the music search feature doesn't work. Really... Doesn't work at all.I upgraded firmware and played all sorts of games to try and get the device to work. Finally I gave up and shipped it back to Amazon. The thing was just more trouble than it was worth.FYI: Amazon returns were great."
"****MAJOR SPOILER****DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW****Before I invested time watching this, I wish I had found a review saying there was a death of a major character at the end. I wouldn't have bothered, it wasn't that good anyway. Maybe this review will save someone. Giving it 2 stars because I've seen abyssal films that only deserve 1-star, and this is not that bad."
"Offshore for so long in his first tour. Then back for only four months, received minor wounds, got medals and ""out"" while others slogged through jungle in the real war.....Kerry is no hero. A biased book the purpose of which is to win an election, not to give a true account of the war.Kerry came back and accused our soldiers of hideous acts of cruelty and murder; he testitied to these facts while our men were still there. Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time. How do you think they were treated by the enemy after hearing what our soldiers did to their people?A disgusting excuse for an objective book. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
This is a great intermediate video. It's one of my favorites. It's set to Motown music and it's very fun. The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down. I don't like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to fast. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics. IT'S FUN!
"I really find it difficult to rate this item for the following reason. I purchased the Dean Martin doll as a novelty item for my wife, a dedicted Dean Martin fan. Unfortunately it did not perform as expected. The mouth would not move. Fortunately I was able to return it for a full refund paid in a timely manner."
"I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress from Sopjie's Choice and The French Lt.'s Woman. Oh, well, I guess one stinker in an otherwise glorious career is to be forgiven. Don't watch unless you are a ""movie masochist."""
"Kiss is a lame band with their image only covering for their many songs with inane lyrics with their makeup and concerts. They could'nt write a song if their lives depended on it. If you want metal, buy a Metallica CD. If you want moronic disgiuses and Cd titles like ""Psycho-Circus"" buy KISS.By the way, only the dumbest band in the world would try to get cash by getting Tood MacFarlane to create a series of comic books and action figures!"
"These are very comfortable, small and light, and they block the ambient noise very well. There are a couple of major problems however. One is that the chord is microphonic. It transmits a loud scraping sound to the earpieces when it rubs on your face or clothing. The other is the response. The only other earphones I have to compare it against are the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3, (a.k.a. Altec Lansing UHP336). The Zen suffers very badly by comparison. It has an uneven frequency response with a bump in the mid treble range around 3kHz to 5kHz that makes it sound shouty. Another nit is that there is no room in the supplied carrying case for the airplane connection adapter."
"If you like Enya and you have them all, then by all means, get this album.Amarantine is beautiful. It's of the same timber as the rest of Enya's albums. [In honesty, if you find a bit of sameness troublesome then perhaps this album is not for you.]There are some variations. ""The River Sings"" has great Bounce. If I need to find a criticism then .... I felt that ""It's In the Rain"" was a little stilted. ...but only a little.I'll put all of Enya's CD's on shuffle play [that's 4 hours of music] and sit down, happy as a clam, with a good book. Amarantine is a good addition to Enya's discography....okay, I don't know what a clam would do with a good book, but I'm sure it would be happy."
I liked Soulbait alittle better than this. But Blaze is still good. I like the futuristic effects on the songs and how they designed the album cover.
"this was the worst example of american literature ever published. warren feels the need to describe such trivial objects as doorknobs, the color of the street, or smell of the rain. is this really needed? this book could have easily been condensed into one half its size. the author's continuing mention of ""The Great Twitch"" has no impact on the average person's life. this book is a waste of your time, don't read it!"
The glue was easy to apply. My boyfriend attached it to his boots which were coming apart in some places ... Unfortunately the spot needing to be fixed wasn't one that could be fixed and the fix did not stay
"Received this keyboard today and was very dissapointed. I can't believe IBM actually allowed Micro Innovations to put their logo on this item. When typing, the keystrokes either were not recognized or would display seconds later. Receiver ""data"" light blinks showing that are you pressing keys, however, the keystrokes are not sent to the computer.Returning item now as I type on a good/working LOGITECH wireless RF keyboard."
"The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches, eat the top off of canapes, avoid the crust) can give a true celiac serious consequences. Sometimes, a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great ""silent damage"" to one's intestines. There are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue. I have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet."
"I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level, because I think this is one terrible book. I read approximately 100 pages on the traits of Fox Edwards, therefore, I was a little upset when I found out it was for no reason. I read with interest the last few pages where I found out that Wolfe's editor had to piece together several parts of this book, and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together. All of this occured after Wolfe's death. I believe this is a collection of ramblings from Thomas Wolfe. I am sure that I can be attacked verbally for not understanding the meaning of this great work, but if it was truly a great work, I would not have missed its significance. Please, play with the kids, walk around the block, start drinking, but don't waste your time on this book."
"This is my favorite book yet (and by the way, I've read quite a few.) Not only is the symbolism masterful, but the book is thoroughly interesting and captivating as well. I am shocked at some of the criticisms of this work of such epic proportions. I honestly can't figure how anyone could find fault with it. I understand that it's not the most enjoyable of experiences to ""read books for school,"" but this one is not one of the ""boring"" kind. The book is beautifully written and Golding's use of metaphor, allegory, and personification is consummate. Golding pulls all he can into this book, details from all walks of life. The book is incredible, as there is a vibrantly suspenseful surface story with ingenious characters and plot, as well as richly deep undertones of life and the depths of human heart and consciousness. All you have to do is read it."
"I ordered this album, but it never came. Beware of third party sellers, because they can be shifty. I certainly wish I could give you a review of this album, but unfortunately I NEVER GOT IT!!"
"Alvin Lee Zoom album is a non pretentious work, but a truly well done one. Simple, direct, great... From start to end is music at its best, to be joyful, to dance, no matter if the lyrics are sad or happy, it fullfills the quest of making musical sounds!"
"These shoes look cute and got good review, so I decided to give them a try. Even though I ordered a half-size larger than I normally wear, they hurt so much when I tried them on that I never even wore them out of the house. I returned them and am planning to buy a pair of Dansko wedges.I should mention that I have very attractive feet - big, flat, and square (like Fred Flintstone) - that only respond well to orthopedic-looking shoes. If your feet are of a daintier variety, these might be fine."
"Really good ! All the classic Aussie songs, including Waltzing Matilda,Botany Bay and Tie Me Kangroo Down...you don't want to miss this one."
"Dune is one of the most inspirational sci/fi books that I hav ever read. The technology in the book seemed to be extremely none feasible to the recent human culture thst sorrounds us as a people. The story of the chosen one,Paul Mau'dib a man that was given to the fremen as there saviour. He was the chosen one, the only male that could stand to the poisonious juice that only the benajesuits have the power as women to resist the power of the jui ce in order to become one of there own. As the story went on thw character of mau'dib feel in tot he world of the fremen and wanted to help them out of there fight for freedom . He was the only one that could do it for them. If he didn't do it he would just be wasting his talent. His talent to control the world in his fingers. He do it all he had the people afraid of what he could do , and it was all over one little insignifacant thing. He now controls the spice and will for a long time never be harmed."
"Captivating throughout. Though in the end, I wasn't shocked by who did it--I had figured it out almost from the beginning. Good twists and turns. I was made to think twice more than once! The characters were well-developed and ""real."" This is movie material to me! Hmmm...Jimmy Smits as the Chief of Police? Kyra Sedgewick as our heroine? I recommend the book. Great beach book."
"This book, which reminded me of To Kill a Mockingbird even though the two are completely unrelated, was very good. It's about confused and lonely teenagers, a crazy deaf Greek, and lonely man, and how they meet and react with each other. Tres interessant!"
Roadsters is one of those games that plays like an arcade racer but has real licensed cars. Both the graphics and the play control are very good and the cars are definetly cool. My only complaint was that there wasnt enough tracks. There are only 6 of them and after a while you just want more.
"I am in complete agreement with the rest of you who have had paper feeding problems. The printer was fine at first although difficult to set up (software). Now, a month later, the printer either doesn't take the paper or jams. It has nothing to do with the quality of the paper. I am also surprised that this wasn't discovered in testing. I also noticed that the ink cartridges keep getting smaller. What a rip off. I have had it with HP printers. I will never buy another."
"This book is out of print and pretty hard to find, but if you ever come across a copy of it I highly reccommend you pick it up. It is a masterpiece of speculative essays. In it, Clarke accurately predicts many things... of course lots of things about space and satellite communications, and even an accurate description of the internet! Also of note are essays on what we should do if we have contact with an alien race, a debunking of UFO sightings (much needed), a debunking of the cliche ""nothing is impossible"" with a listing of things that are, much talk on the speed of light and relativity, and of course a lot about space. The two most interesting essays in my view are one that speculates on what the Star of Bethleham (Clarke settles on a supernova). Also, there is the short essay ""God and Einstein"" which is one of the most thought-provoking things I have ever read in my life. Highly reccommended."
"Loved it in the 80's, story and humor sill holds up! Kevin Bacon young and energetic. Great fun!Spawned sequels which don't hold a candle to this original."
"These two albums have been (thankfully) put on one CD. Doris is at her best here, particularly with sassy renditions of ""Cheek to Cheek"" and ""Easy to Love."" The title song, with its slow beginning to its jazzy ending, is sung by Doris in an ironic and humorous manner; even the composer admits that her rendition of ""Horray for Hollywood"" is the best version by any singer. On Volume 2, she sings wistfully of ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" and ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" as well sings coyly ""Nice Work If You Can Get It"" and ""I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm."" Also, ""Over the Rainbow"" and ""Blues in the Night"" are stand-outs."
I ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was. I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was. I have a 3 month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it. I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn't even able to fit a change of clothes. I tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky. All in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn. I wouldn't recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.
"To many hamsun readers this one will seem to be quite a departure for Hamsun, as it is an urban tale centering around a bohemian clique, rather than the usual tale of the Norwegian peasantry. As I know only those that are already Hamsun fans will ever read this, let it suffice to say that this book is as good as any of his works (even Pan), so hurry up and get a copy..."
It was a good book I finished it in 3 days it was very very very short and I loved the movie
"Years ago, the Hollywood Reporter print subscription had everything any pro or aspiring pro in the movie business needed to know. The current print version is more for movie fans than the industry trade it used to be. You must subscribe to the digital online version to get the industry information instead of the print version now."
Its a shame this book fails in its promise to expose a conspiracy but it makes for some good fiction. The author seems to feel that FDR was a communist and the reason he allowed Pearl Harbor to be attacked is to spread communisim around the world.I was left confused and bewilderd by Mr. Willey's arguments as most of the evidence presented was taken out of order or mixed and matched to fit his argument.
"It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!"
"By most accounts, the Michael Bay-directed Transformers films to date are not very good, but that hasn't stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash, and this third installment, Dark of the Moon, made the most of them all. This time around, Sam Witwicky and the Autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient Autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon, but the Decepticons interfere, and things aren't exactly as they seem. I found Dark of the Moon to be an improvement over the second installment, with some impressive special effects work and action sequences, but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Don't expect to find much more to the movie than ""Ooh, big robots and explosions!"" But hey, for some, that's really all you need."
"I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade), I found it very hard to follow and too symbolic. This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something ""deeper"" and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you."
This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish. The plot wanders aimlessly and is hard to follow. Mnay of the other continuations are better than this so I would recommend saving your money.
"We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!"
"I bought these Dickies work pants , we used to call them ""chinos"" in the 1950s,don't ask me why.Ok so they are comfortable and light to wear not heavy canvas pants which is what ""bluejeans"" really. You walk around in heavy canvas pants or dungarees and wonder why your legs get tired so easy! DA! Anyway I woke up and now I will wear light workpants like Dickies and relax. I do recommend these to anyone ."
I ordered the hardcover book pictured at a price of $66. I received a paperback with a cover price of 95 cents! Waiting to hear from the seller.
"It's a good product for 11m band CB Radio, not too long and long enough for a SWR acceptable.there is also a rubber cover on the pedestal who can prevent from the paint damage"
"I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class, and fell in love with it. It's simply chilling in it's portrayal of the ""future"" and the deliberate ambiguity about Clarrise is very cool. The deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling. A very poignant book, it's definitely a must-read."
my brother loves these game. )hes favorite is the one for computer but we lost the disk when i was in kindergarten) when this comes out tell me how great it is!
"Yeah, same wisecracking dialogue, sidekicks, and relationship quandaries as the Spenser novels.Realized the plot was familiar a few chapters in-- lifted from previous early Spencer novel.Characterizations inconsistent and contrived if not absurd-- a lot of villainous stereotypes-- and the plot point that the whole story is based on is ludicrous.There are much better written ""guilty pleasures"" than this one-- some by the same author."
This is the only film I have watched so far. This is not up to the usual British Cinema quality either in acting or content. I didn't watch to the end. Once he found himself tied up in bed I turned it off.
"I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame."
"Finally such an amazing movie appears on DVD! It is no wonder Ingrid Bergman won the Academy Award for this film. She is spectacular as an abused wife, driven mad by her husband.The ONLY reason I gave it 4-stars is because you can get it cheaper somewhere else. The actual publisher's list price is $14.99 and I'm not entirely sure why Amazon offers it for almost $2 more. This is the same with the Masterpiece Edition Alice in Wonderland. Amazon lists the price as $29.99, but in stores the list price is $24.99. Curiouser and curiouser."
"This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer."
"This is a very nice tripod, is strong, elegant and cool, I love it, but the only trouble that I find it, it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras, I mean I am an owner of 2 sony cybershot camera`s, the W80 and H2 and I am not able to use the remote control with my cameras, only because Sony do not give us that information"
All I needed was something to sharpen pencils with. We always get those cheap sharpeners that cost 50 cents at walmart.....no good. This is perfect.
"When I first heard this album I loved it. After listening to it more closely, I still like it a lot, but am not quite so blown away by it. When it first came out, it might have been groundbreaking, but so much has happened since in the world of technical/avant-garde metal, that much of this album now sounds a little tame. The material hasn't aged very well. There are a couple of truly great songs in the middle-- all of the others are definitely good, just not mind-blowing (as some of the material on their older albums still is). The new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band-- a great improvement over Snake, in my opinion. If you want a truly great album, though, get their next, ""Phobos."""
"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. I had bought some of the ""trucks"" and wanted him to have Bob and Wendy too. I found this set and thought it would be great. They ONLY good thing about this set is that he has Bob and Wendy.The clicking blocks sound like a great concept, but they don't work. If you can get them to click you are lucky. You can not build anything with this set. The box shows a house, buildings, etc., but you can't build these thing because the magnets are in the wrong places and the roofs make the whole thing top heavy!I would avoid this set unless you just really need Bob and Wendy (like us)."
"Despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente, todo tiene sentido y gracias a estos conocimientos he podido ayudar a otras seres a vivir su vida con un proposito que es ser mejores cada dia para pasar de nivel en nuestro crecimiento espiritual; este libro no es para aquellas personas que le tienen miedo a la verdad; pero si te atrevez a leerlo te aseguro que tu vida jamas volvera a ser la misma.ATREVETE!!!"
"I know the whole point of ""dummie"" and ""KISS"" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn't gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste."
"I'm not a hard person to please, but this CD makes me want to vomit. If you are looking for 12 songs that sound the same, then this is your CD. If you're looking for something with a little variety, look elsewhere. I am a huge fan of Clay's, but was very disappointed with this CD. If you've heard one of the songs, you've pretty much heard them all."
The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
"I was lucky to see this movie on TCM not long ago, and enjoyed every moment of it. I would absolutely love to own it on DVD......sooner rather than later. Fabulous move, and Cary Grant is great in it!!"
"I got this for my kids to use at home and for a few months it was a good little sharpener. Suction works well, not messy to dump out the shavings, etc. However, the teeth on the wheels grinded too much and stopped making the sharpening piece inside to turn."
"Don't waste time or money on this garbage - you can't mount it, and the replacement battery is very expensive. Useless!"
"awesome shoes. what can i say. look great with pants, jeans, khakis. whatever. versatile, durable, sylish. you won't regret this purchase. maybe run a half size bigger than my size. but it's iffy."
THe biggest problem with this DVD is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews. Several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on James's brake line. The episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the DVD. It would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order. Other than that it is a good DVD with 8 Thomas and Friends stories in which James is prominent. I have a personal complaint too. I purchased this in a store not online. Even though the box said it includes a bonus WOODEN train. My box actually had a TAKE ALONG Bertie in it. My son didn't have a Bertie so I was eager to get it but I didn't realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series. My son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.
"THe song of the title menu sung by two women in the same beautiful style of THE FLOWER DUET from LAKMÉ by Delibes, is Antonio Vivaldi's Concerto in G major for two guitars/mandolins , ADAGIO. I don't know who is performimg the beautiful song. I have been trying to find it in other CD but it seems almost impossible. can anyone help me? israelonofre@yahoo.com.br"
"What is this series? I guess it is romance, in the same genre as those thick novels with a woman and Fabio on the cover. If one starts this book with that in mind, you won't be disappointed. It still has Ayla inventing everything and healing everyone, and Jondalar is still an amusingly dumb blond with one endearing attribute. The animal friends are still there, wowing the prehistoric residents of France. Auel still manages to make sex scenes tiresome -- singlehandedly she may keep teenagers from having sex because she makes it seem so boring.But a fun bubble-head read nonetheless. Smart of the publisher to release this book in May -- it is the perfect beach read."
This is a good lesson learned book and brings to mind in reading the importance of sharing with joy. All should learn from this book s message.
"The purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society. The audience is primarily Americans, though the book has been well received in several foreign countries. De Graaf and his associates present powerful evidence from a wide collection of sources. Their argument is persuasive and well documented. They address environmental, social, financial, spiritual, physical and mental indicators of health in our society. Affluenza has made me more aware of how I spend my money, time and intellectual effort by highlighting some of our societies weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the book because it made me question some of my practices. The authors throw down the gauntlet by challenging many ""American principles."" Overall, the argument is sound and effective, if a bit dramatic at times. A copy of should come free with every new BMW, satellite TV dish and MBA degree. America needs it."
Only keeps coffee tepid at best. Actual element gets very hot; it just doesn't reach the coffee. Item is small enough to stay on the table. It makes an expensive coaster.
"I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I'd end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!"
"Not a bad movie -- not great, but better than average until the shareholder's meeting at the end. However, the speech that Larry the Liquidator (Danny DeVito) gives at the meeting is great! Larry explains -- very clearly -- why corporate takeovers are not a bad thing, and even why liquidation of an underperforming business is good. His speech ranks right up there with Francisco D'Anconia's speech in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged."
I own dozens of Haynes and Chilton manuals and they actually show you how to service something. This book goes over NOTHING. It gives very basic info that doesn't help you at all. I was working on a 10yr old Duetz and it had a few pages on 70's models but no spec sheet or repair info on anything. I ended up having to pay someone to service it because I couldn't track down specs and apparently neither could the author of this book. WASTE OF MONEY
This book is hilarious! But it is also very helpful. I learned a lot of new tatics and approach. Women have a lot of power and when used properly we can get what we want from a man.
"This is truly a electronic masterpiece and will never been forgotten. I have been a big fan of Moby for quite some time now, but I have found myself skipping a song here or their on some of his other albums. This CD is one of those CD's you want to leave on repeat all day, and listen to it through and through. On this album Moby remixes a lot of old blues songs, and briliantly brings them to life. He takes electronic music to a whole new level with this album. If you don't own any Moby, start here. And if you love the smash hit ""Porcelain"" or ""Everloving"" you'll want to check out his album ""I Like to Score"" as another great Moby CD to own. If you haven't started listening to Electronic music at all START HERE!"
"Very poorly written book. It's all over the place. The ""f"" word seemed to be thrown in simply to fill space. At times I didn't have the slightest clue what she was talking about. She tried to be funny - and failed miserably. And besides being boring and poorly written she frequently takes cheap shots at republicans, which were just distracting and irritating.Simply put this book is nothing like I was expecting and I am so glad that I got a copy from the library and didn't contribute one dime to this woman's bank account. I returned it to the library the very next day - unfinished.Very disppointing, this was such a good idea for a book and a movie, but Julie Powell just wasn't up to the task...at least not to my standards."
"Of all McCartney's lost albums, this is the one that most richly deserves to be found. Old Siam Sir sits with other forgotten Mccartney classic rockers such as Girls' School, Soily and The Mess all of which fit neatly with the best Rock and Roll he wrote for that other group (in many ways they are rawer than most of what he wrote for them). Arrow Through Me is one of those delicate pieces that McCartney writes that somehow manage to rock in a subtle way. The Rockestra highlights work well on this album, but are perhaps better on Concert for Kampuchea. The generally stripped down sound of this album allows the listener to appreciate the musicianship of Wings Mark 3. Give it a listen, you want be disappointed, particularly if you like the better moments on the Mccartney album"
"The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters, I still couldn't care less about Tim. The prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat."
"Let me blunt; I direct hard core full on, bondage and s&m; porn for a living. There is very little that can upset me or get inside my skin and bother me for days and weeks afterwards...but this movie did it. I almost had to turn away while watching and I did have nightmares. I would also find myself staring off into the distance reliving the most disturbing parts in my mind.This is, without a doubt, a masterpiece. I doubt I will ever watch it again but a movie than create such emotion within the viewer deserves a good, honest review."
These diapers are the best. I cannot say enough about them. In my opinion they are much better than Huggies and fit true to size. I feel that Huggies run really small. They are also so soft I feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin. I will use these again with my next baby.
"I caught this movie today on LMN, when I was channel surfing. Unfortunately I missed the first 25 minutes. I tried not to let Kent Moran distract me from the plot, but he's gorgeous. He's a screenwriter, musician and actor huh? Not just a pretty face. Anyways, back to the movie... It was a movie about real people, that I could relate to. I'm buying this so I can see what I missed."
"I really wanted to love this moisturizer! I have very fair, sensitive skin, and this was supposed to be one of the best bets for my skin type. It also has a great high SPF.But, alas it does not sink into my skin. It does not blend well at all. It leaves a terrible white residue that takes forever to rub in.Maybe because of the high SPF? I am not sure,but I was definitely disappointed."
Dvd movie was as promised. Very satisfied. Thank you. Saw this movie ages ago when it came out. Still very good.
"No good... as bad as the Curse of the Pink Panther..... unwatchable!Frankly there is only one Peter Sellers and no doubles can compare just as there is only one Herbert Lom without whom there is no Pink Panther either! If you are a fan get the S.Martin remake, it is rather good and Dryfus is well defined. But do SKIP this one!"
"Having made the change to Veganism recently, and discovering Seitan, I was expecting this cookbook to open the door to non-meat Paradise! The description of the book, and the reviews of others made it sound like the Holy Grail.Bah.I'd say 40-50% of the recipes using the prepared Seitan call for the ""wheat-meat"" to be battered and deep fried. So WHERE is the healthy cooking in THAT? I was looking for recipes for the actual Seitan preparation, using different seasonings and flavors, and then hoping to find a fake meatloaf recipe, or a fake turkey and stuffing for Thanksgiving.I'm still looking."
"These album is their best work yet, the songs are an interesting conbination of the songs from the albums they did before. The songs has the basic things from the first record, and the elegancy and sofistication of ""What the story morning glory"" as well, you will hear more details in these one.These is the band of the 90's...and they will be the band of the 2000's of course, so buy it now. Noel is a tired and true music god."
"I bought this for a friend who had never seen it. I was going to let them borrow mine, but decided to just get them their own since it was so reasonable. Gotta love it!"
The first Spiderman was way better than this garbage. the acting was horrible and the action scenes... well there were hardly any action scenes. This movie sucked there was way too much talking. Doc Oc was horrible he wasn't even mean. don't waste your money.
"This has become one of my favorite annual Christmas viewings and the funniest of my very large library of Christmas specials. So original and creative, and so very hilarious. Good pickup for just about anybody."
Since the 670 is a discontinued model the price reduction on Amazon was tremendous. For less than $320 you get the following features- Spoken street names (although they often indistinguishable via computerized voices)- Bluetooth cell phone reception (with a bluetooth phone which works very well)- FM traffic monitor (of limited usefulness)- US/Canada & European maps (relative up to date; for the latest maps you get one updated map free and the other must be purchased)- Car & a separate home recharger- Front Window mount- Close to 6 million POI's- Car/Truck/Motorcylce/Walking modes- One way point before end destination- Old style flip antenna (instead of built in)- Very bright screen- Speaker could be louder-I took the unit on a recent trip and it was at least 90% accurate with recent (within the year) roads and freeways often not given. Highly recommended.
"This is a good movie and a decent portrayal of Luther. The plot is well done for the volumes of information covered, the acting is adequate, and the costumes are outstanding.Some of the actors' personal beliefs portions of the historical representations and the film is definitely from the perspective of the Lutheran Church. While relatively ballanced, one must still keep the presuppositions of those who created it in mind when viewing the historical material.The producers could have expounded on some additional elements in the time period that were directly related that might have helped a bit more in keeping the bias level less apparent, but the film definitely falls way short of being the 'Protestant Propoganda' some critics have labeled it.While not your Saturday Night Date flic, it is most assuredly a well done film and worth watching."
but I liked him better on American Idol. I'm glad that others like it his cd and that he's doing really well on the charts.
"Let me say that I had never heard of Diane Arbus before watching this movie. In a nutshell, She meets the stranger living in the attic of her apartment bldg who has a medical condition that makes his appearance that of a werewolf. He is just as creepy as she is. She falls ""madly"" in love with him, takes up photography with the majority of her photos being that of his hallway and front door (yes thats right), neglects her family and becomes weirdly obsessed with her hairy lover. Strange movie. I found it disturbing."
"Garbage is a band like no other. You really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little album.This album is packed FULL of classic Garbage songs that can really give you the chills. The opening track ""Temptation Waits"" was very eerie the first time I heard it and I loved it. The next track ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for, love the lyrics too.A great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru Garbage. A word of advice though...don't bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fan...defienatley not impressive."
"It is obvious that Clay Aiken has talent- there is no fooling about that. He is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now. However, the people producing this album did a poor job showcasing the talent that Clay Aiken holds. Every song on this album sounds the same. The emotions portrayed by Clay are not very diverse; every emotion fits into either the category of ""I am singing about pain"" or ""We are going to get through the pain"". The truth is that this album is painful enough to actually sit and listen to. The only song on this less-than-quality debut that is worth listening to is the title track, ""Measure Of A Man."" This song is in a realm of its own, actually having a worthwhile message.In summation, the talent is there, the album is not. Maybe next time, Clay."
"This eight pound bag lasts our cockatoo 2-3 months. Way more economical to buy here on Amazon than in the store. We reseal it for storage, and use it well before it goes stale (colours and smells still vibrant)."
This is a great tale I loved every second of it! It is by far one of the best stories I have had the pleasure of reading!
"Out of all the shopping I have done through Amazon, this is the only thing I will be returning! The book only measures 6 3/4 x 4 1/4, has very small print and obscure black and white illustrations at the beginning of each chapter. In the same order I received James Herriot's ""Treasury for Children"" which, for the same price, is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, and what I also expected from this book!"
"I loved The Hobbit. It was a fun, delightful read. Tolkien was obviously the narrator, and he had a way of inserting little quips that would make me chuckle. The story moved along quite nicely, as it was short, and you ended the book feeling like the story had come full circle. I would recommend that everyone should read this - it's a classic!"
"Just throw them away after 12 hours? I assume these are plastic. So, folks after 12 hours they are obsolete, and throw them out to create more useless landfill trash that will last 10 millenia! Yay, hooray!"
"Strange things definitely happen in this book, like Olivia staying married to Malcolm, when she definitely had the means to leave. Locking Alicia away for something that was not her fault was another strange thing about this book. Overall, it is a good book with a lot of twists and keeps you guessing."
This book has been a great help to us as we work with our Russian guests. We are never going to be fluent in Russian but this little handbook makes communication possible. Thank you .
"The cover shows a cute, silly picture of a dog. I was expecting greeting card type goofy pictures and captions. The pictures were okay, the captions were tasteless, sick and far from funny. What a waste."
"The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it."
"My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version, some sounds repeat. There are several points where the DVD appears to skip and replay a short sequence that it just played. The colors are extremely poor -the cave scenes are supposed to be darker but here we struggled to actually see anything that was happening. I like the film, but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy."
"Yes, Devil Conspiracy at it's finest..this is a true 1960ish classic and another epic from Roman Polanski.How the lifestyle of Doris Day becomes satanic..This Devil worship genre was heavy stuff in the mid 1960's coming as it did with the saga of Sharon Tate, Charles Manson and Polanski somehow tied into all of this.Nonetheless murder is murder and this movie is the depiction of darkness, Lucifer, evil with the premise of the birth of the antichrist.Rosemary herself (a witch not by choice), battles endlessly with herself and her emotions as if reason could win.... This movie blurs all distinction between madness and reality as seen through the eyes of Rosemary.A truly remarkable groundbreaking flick that contrasts good and evil, passion and reason, a highly entertaining movie with a a great cast of future stars.The extras are good."
"I have really thick shoulder length hair. I only wash my hair twice a week and once my hair is dry and straightened, I don't need to do a thing with it. This product works really well for me as long as I have the time to spare. I takes me at least 30 or 40 minutes to dry and straighten my hair once it has been towel dried. I bought this product because I didn't want to spend the money for more expensive similar items. I think that for the price....the infiniti is well worth it."
"This drum is sweet. It looks amazing coming out of the box, a classic, beautiful design. I swapped the stock Weather Master heads for an Emperor Coated/ Clear Ambassador Reso. Also swapped stock snares for 42-strand wires. No complaints about sound from this beauty.My only complaint to date is the strainer. The standard P-85 strainer would often get snagged when moving the snares from off to on. This sucks big time when you're in the middle of a song, fighting with the strainer to co-operate. I got desperate and almost snapped the arm off it once. This may have been a problem on my end, seating it incorrectly or something. I'll soon swap to a P-86 strainer.Also, watch out for fingerprints on this! The chrome looks awesome when it's clean, however fingerprints really stand out.. and drive me mad. Minor detail but thought it was worth mentioning.Overall, very good drum. If mine got stolen or destroyed in a fire I would buy another."
"This album is a MAJOR disappointment because Clay Aiken has so much promise as an entertainer. His charisma and talent, so evident on American Idol, are noticeably missing on this album of mediocre songs. The title alone was a bad choice - Kevin Sharp also released a ""Measure of a Man"" in the 90s (and was much more deserving to use it, since he was battling cancer at the time of its recording) and this collection of forgettable tracks won't give Clay the staying power he will need to stay afloat in the cutthroat entertainment world. Please, American Idol - you got them through the door, but that means nothing if they can't stay there. Bad album from a bright talent."
This pacifier was the best part of my son's Halloween costume. We got so many compliments on it. It is so much easier than putting a baby in a goofy costume they don't want to be in.
"I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it. And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist. I read ""On The Road"", ""The Town and The City"", and just before this one, ""The Subterraneans"", which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long ! This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down. If you really like Jack you should also check out James Baldwin and Norman Mailer."
This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish.
This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
"I bought this for my daughter to try. Her hair is thin and about 2"" past her shoulders. while using our regualr shampoo & conditioner, her hair was easily mangeable and looked and felt healthy.AFter using Mane n' tail, her hair felt thicker, dry, and tangled very easily. Working with her hair after using this shampoo was hard. I took her into the barber shop for a trim & the beautician commented on how dry her hair was. It was not dry before using this shampoo.Skip it! It's not worth damaging your hair. We'll stick to what's been working for us."
"Great quality for the price and does everything i need it to do, it is very large, like the size of a clothing iron about."
"My sister who lives close by used this Canada Green grass seed and her lawn is fabulous! I fear I""m more exhuberance than skill and it didn't do well in my yard. I""m will to give it another try! Be informed that there's a LOT of rye in it which means in warm weather it won't do well."
Basic Informative book on keeping siberian chipmunks as pets. My used copy was in great condition.Chipmunks
"This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book ""The 50 worst films of all time"". It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos, and better than some of those!"
"In the very first chapter the motion picture frame of war coverage on the Roer river in Germany, it shows the dates 1942-1943, but the invasion of Europe never happend until June 1944. Please explain."
Sorry but I had alot of trouble even finishing this book. I've read the entire series so far and enjoyed all the others. There are so many characters one needs some sort of outline to keep track of who's who. The dialouge is extremely tedious with far too much small talk that adds nothing but words to the book. I'm thinking Ms Auel wrote this in a hurry to fullfil a contract obligation.
"Nortan (Fight Club; American History X), Elfman (Sitcom ""Dharma and Greg""), and Stiller (Meet the Parents) light it up in this warm-hearted comedy about 3 friends from grade school who haven't seen each other in year, now thrown back together when Elfman comes running back into their lives. Nortan and Stiller, now clergymen, (Nortan a Catholic Priest, Stiller a Jewish Rabbi) both find the old friendship they once knew in their beloved tom-boyish beauty of a friend Elfman. But throughout it all, there is denial, lying, antitrust, and a passionate love triangle forms. Now who will end up following their faith and who will end up following their hearts? Nortan, Elfman, and Stiller deliver a spectacular and heart gripping performance in this romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed by men nor women alike."
"See the reviews for the AUA-1422 - a similar item with one extra 1394 port. Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V, 2.1A), and used to offer one that fit them through their store, but apparently no longer do! Without the adapter, this unit is only usable for items that draw almost no power through the USB or 1394 connection - which is a shame, because the Adaptec 1394 implementation was always the most stable on my machines. Look for one that includes an AC adapter or some other way of bringing power to the unit instead."
"This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond ""I'm rich and you're not,"" and ""Oh, how I do love the lady Estella."" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring."
"poor Adam Crall, reviewer. Cameroon is its own, French-speaking nation in Africa. It is NOT in South Africa, which is also an independent nation."
"This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star."
"I am extremely proud of you, Clay...Your album is everything I expected and more !!! I was very impressed with your songs and ""always"" with your amazing and beautiful voice. God has truly blessed you with a gift and a beautiful soul !!! I am proud to shout to the world ""I am a Clay Aiken's Fan...and he is my American Idol"". Keep up your good work, in all that you do.You are an AMAZING person. I look forward to ALL of your albums."
"Although I haven't read this book by Nicky Cruz, I thought I'd just add my own ""2 cents"". This is just a bit of trivia about the author. This is the same Nicky Cruz who is mentioned in the book, The Cross and The Switchblade. He was portrayed in the 1970's movie, of the same name, by a young Eric Estrada (TV's CHIPS)."
"Finally,it's going to happen on April 25,2000. I just couldn't believe that a video of one of the best musicals ever made didn't exist. My daughter and I recorded it years ago when she was little and we have watched it over and over for years. You have to get this movie just for the songs which were nominated for the Academy Awards. This movie is destined to become an all time classic. Now, many more people will get to experience the best Cinderella story of all. It's been long overdue."
I enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme .look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think. An individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general
"I wonder why Amazon will not post my review of this album. I loved clay on american idol - but he lost get over it. This album is average at best. Stop pushing him as though he won. Reuben is the winner and Clay's ""Measure of a Man"" does not measure up to Reuben's ""Soulful""."
"I remember reading this when I was a kid. I always thought it was a pretty neat book. Time travel is always a cool thing to read about, and this one is pretty good too. One of the best things I remember is writing a letter to the author. She wrote me a full-length letter back! For an 11-year-old kid, that's quite a thrill. I recommend this book for any children's book library."
"I received my first of these flashlights as a gift. After it was stolen out of my truck, I bought two more. It is compact and durable. The xenon light is very bright and the LEDs provide a good close distance flood light. The best features are the compactness and light options. The negative aspects are the special battery requirements and the weight. I still like this flashlight better than the MAGlite."
"Do you find it interesting that all the people giving this excellent book a rating of one have dozens of spelling and grammar errors in their reviews? I think that is just about the least shocking thing I have ever seen. And can anyone tell me where the schools that ""make"" students read Tolkien are? At my school we have to read crap like ""The Scarlet Letter"". I am jealous of you people who were ""forced"" to read this book! In the sixth grade my teacher suggested that I read ""The Hobbit"" and L.O.T.R. Since then I have been a Fantasy MANIAC! I followed it up with Terry Brooks and Death Gate and I haven't stopped yet. I owe it all to The Hobbit! How could anyone not like this book?"
"Clay Aiken is the reason I enjoyed the second season of AI so much. His voice is so pure and strong. It's almost like listening to an angel sing. It is apparent that he has such a big heart and he puts so much feeling into his songs. It doesn't matter what he sings, he does an outstanding job. I bought his album and I have to say I think its the best FIRST album of any american idol thus far. Any song he sings that broadcasts his voice range just awes me. Anybody that doesn't think this young man is talented needs to have their hearing checked. He is Spectacular! In my opinion Clay should have won AI..hands down! Definitely an album worth owning."
"At the core of the movie is an affecting concept: a man who falls in love with a woman who can't remember him the following morning. So each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again. It's a touching situation and the two co-leads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm. However this wasn't enough for the marketing & development people, so they added a ton of crude slap-stick and a lot of stale and offensive sexual ""humor."" This robs the movie of any chance it might have had to touch the viewer's heart, and left me wondering how the movie ever made it out of the cutting room. The earlier movie in which these two co-leads appeared, The Wedding Singer, was fortunate enough not to suffer from these drawbacks. 50 First Dates is a movie worth missing."
I watched and compared the Blu-ray to my DTS DVD. Don't support this kind of crap transfers. I will wait for this to be done right. I gave it two stars only for the audio. The video is really annoying!

I really enjoyed this book. It gives you a different perspective on Sept. 11th. We have read so many stories of the people who perished on that day and this story talks about those people who were totally inconvenienced by the events. It is so interesting to hear their stories and how this little town welcomed these people from all over the world. Many of the stories are very heartwarming and also sad. Once you get started it is a hard book to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who has more interest in reading about 9/11.
"I had really grown to enjoy Perez-Reverte's books after first reading some of his other stories such as the Fencing Master, the Flander's Panel, and the Queen of the South. I thought I'd gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at $.45, but sometimes it's better to hang on to loose change. In this book, the plot was weak from beginning to end, and the climax was unrealistic, even with a stretch of the imagination. I was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable, anyway. On several occasions I thought about putting the book down, and had I not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do, I probably would have. This book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books, regardless of quality, before a certain date."
I was very impressed with it. It take stills and movie clips great and it so small. Great pocket p.c. add on .
This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ
"I was impressed with how Mr. Philbrick was able to share just the right amount of detail. When reading the narrative of the canniblaism I was just about to shout, enough! when he stopped. The book flowed well and was never boring. The explanations of whaling and the culture, both in Nantucket and on ship, were well done. The sadness of wrong decisions and how they can have such a devestating affect on others is something many of us can relate to as we make decisions throughout life. I appreciated the Epilogue, but felt the extensiveness of the Notes were unnecessary. It was already evident that much research had gone into this book. This book is certainly not for everyone. those who are looking for a love story will not find it here. It is a true story about people coping in an extreme situation and what they feel they must resort to."
"This item was out of stock, so I did not receive it. However, I received timely notification from Amazon.com."
"I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past."
What else to expect from a Cato Institute publication? They support the corporatism of space as the last frontier.
My girls love this. It looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well. I tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead. The shapes are easy to put together & they look realistic.
I must admit that the title caught my attention. Sad to say the music won't. It reminded me of being in a department store elevator stuck in the mezzanine and unable to get out. You can save yourself. If you want good exotica buy a Les Baxter CD.
"This is a very good movie. It is so easy to be able to order old movies and enjoy them again and again,"
read this book and it was the same as the movie or the series that I saw a good read from cover to cover
"Fox has provided Dude, Where's My Car? with a great DVD package that consists of excellent picture and sound quality, along with a handful of cool extras that are sure to please fans. For those who have never seen the film, I recommend a rental if you're a fan of ""stupid"" comedies, as it is a fairly funny and entertaining flick. 2 stars."
"After being nearly obsessed with Into Thin Air and The Climb, I eagerly awaited the latest book from Lene (I also lived in and speak Danish -- an added bonus). However, I found Lene's chronicle pretty weak, with little background or insight in the writing. This book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such. For gaining insight into the state of mind for Lene, it was interesting. For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy, stick to the other 2 books."
"HOW ODD!!!!! just as it really counts the decepticons learn to aim straight managing to wipe out five of the original transformers in one go after numerous attempts. Much as this film is very very good and the music is outstanding. But it has as always all the same tramsformers inconstincies. But much to all our pleasure it has all the wounderful and debonair wit of Starscream that we have all come to know and love and with Leonard Nimoy adding a nice ""Edge"" to Galvatron... Still all in all a Very Good Purchase."
If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much.
"Sure, it's good for a 17-year-old, but that doesn't make it good literature. I think I've seen fan fiction better than this.So many elements of the plot, locations, even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. I read this in 6th grade and, of course, loved it. Now I've gone back, re-read it, and it's almost painful, how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid. It's good for a 17-year-old, sure, but to me, that doesn't save it from being mediocre.Nonetheless, if he keeps this up, Paolini shows great promise at an older age. But for now, I'd much rather read Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials', or anything by Tolkein,instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel. Kids will probably love it, but anyone older will probably be able to see through it."
"This book was profane and pointless, as is w/ most books I'm forced to read for English. I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my beliefs being violated. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
"I guess it's just personal taste, but I'm sorry to say that I did not really like Dune that much. I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night. The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me. Your mileage may vary...I won't be reading any of the remaining books."
"WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?................this ranks with the other completely useless,horrible horror sequals-blair witch(they both were horrible though!),an american psycho 2,evil dead 2(it was hysterical though),exorcist 2,american werewolf in paris.....the list goes on(in fact i think ill make 1!)this was as spine chilling as killer smirfs.can someone explain this to me?what does it have to do with part one?PLEASE DO NOT BUY,RENT,STEAL,OR BORROW.youd be better off with plan 9 from outer space!"
"I like this story the most of Hardy's works. An interesting tale with some good, realistic characters. I think I'll read it again."
"Clay, once again suprises me..I have listened to this CD thinking how could he be better--he is! Clay's voice, range, his use of his God given talent is astounding. All the songs are wonderful especially Invisible and Measure of a Man! He gets better and better and I hope he has a long wonderful journey ahead. I would recommend this CD to everyone. What a great addition to every music library."
"This book takes each book of the Bible and gives a background on the setting in which it was written. The author puts all the information in very understandable words. It does give one an understanding of the times when the writing takes place. It is necessary for those who know nothing about the history of the writings of the books of the Bible. It is more of a reference book than an ""easy read.""It is a good book for understanding sections of the bible and explaining them to others. Good for RCIA groups.Donna Murphy"
"I started using this on the recommendation of a sports car mechanic (lug nuts). I then started using it on anything that was going to be exposed the the weather. Now things like spark plugs, head bolts, license plate bolts etc. It ALWAYS works, the bolts come off w/o a breaker bar but never comes loose either. I have been using it for about 5 years now and it has never caused any kind of problem, except maybe the silver colored product itself is hard to wipe off of your hands and work clothes. Actually, that is a plus, I know it will stay where I put it, not leak out under heat or pressure. All of my friends now have a tube in their workshop, I see them using it everywhere. It is cheap enough and solves tons of problems...get a tube yourself, you will never regret it."

"There's one good chapter, a good story, about survival. Otherwise, the pretentious Frenchman force feeds the reader his personal philosophy through a superfluous writing style. His name matches his style, long-winded and pretentious."
Very enjoyable movie that is rather accurate historically on the big points. It showed Luther as a man tormented by his demons as he tried to stay faithful to the Word of God.
"Louisa May Alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the March sisters:Amy,Meg,Beth and Jo.The way she describes it,tells the story,has a touch of old-fashioned charm in it,taking one back to the days of long gowns,bonnets,rich lords and ladies and the such.The four sisters' personalities are also vividly described in Louisa Alcott's eyes."
Explains how to view education in terms of the whole person. There are also people you can meet who can help you follow this approach. This is the real genius of the author: he not only wrote well but there are people who he has educated in this way and who are available to get to know.
"I've followed The Coconutheads since the early nineties as they've performed throughout south Florida. Their live performance would make a great album too! Val and Greg have a have an almost telepathic connection on stage... their saxophonist (Nicky, I think) is outrageous, mixing in jazzy, moody tones with great skill. The band has had some personnel changes, but the core members have stayed intact, although I miss the live drummer."
This style is for broadway. The songs are blend!.. He will not last making those type of songs!
The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
"As reviewer Joe Pickett said, this book is well-written and enjoyable. My personal preference is for single state travel books, because they are more exhaustive in their coverage, and thus more useful when traveling. The reason for this review is my amusement at finding an earlier review of this book from 2000 written by Joe Pickett. Joe Pickett is the name of the fictional hero of author C.J. Box's excellent mystery series set in Wyoming, and these books started appearing in 2001, after this review, with the award winning Open Season. I love these books, a perfect blend of mystery and western. So what say you, Mr. Box? Did you write the 2000 review for this book? I also can't help but wonder if C.J. Box is your real name. Perhaps you are a relative of Edgar Box, Gore Vidal's famous pseudonym."
"This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles."
the publisher said soon to be a movie. does anyone know if a movie was ever created?
"I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book or anything by this author."
"I was so looking forward to this game being released, I was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date. Delay after delay. I bought the game the day of it's release. Loaded it onto my computer, and was ready to play. I had one disappointment after another. First, the controls were different from her other games. OK I will get use to the new ones. Second, and the biggest. Controlling her is virtually impossible. She is jerky, sporadic, and down right slow and awkward. I have had to reload the game about 20 times to get her to do a simple maneuver. I have given up many times in shear frustration. Frustration I haven't felt in her other games. I do not think I will continue playing this game. It is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game, which is what games are all about. Sorry Core and Eidos, this could be your biggest mistake especially now that the movies are doing so well. What a boost this could have been for you."
"The ink was inexpensive, considering how much ink it is. I think it will take me at least a year or two to use it all. I've been writing with the pen nonstop as my primary pen for 2 months and the first bottle isn't even noticiably lower on ink. Shipping was also fast and everthing arrived in good shape. Overall a great experience."
"Franz Schmidt's diary is written in a pity, vigorous style which probably reflects the way he went about his unenviable business. The supporting material is just what is needed to make us understand the world of Franz Schmidt."
"Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as ""Discontinued"". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion."
I think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time. What a piece of garbage. Can't come close to original.
"This is the kind of book where you realize early on that the writer isn't talented enough to pull off what she's set out to do. Sad, since I was looking forward to reading this, based on the jacket copy. Oh well. This reviewer recommends that others look elsewhere for a compelling read."
"Ralph Towner has got to be one of the finest guitarists thathas ever lived. This live album is spectacular. I have hadthe great fortune of seeing Ralph perform live on severaloccasions in the 1970's: solo, with Oregon, and with thePaul Winter Consort. His performances were nothing butawe inspiring! This album is a masterpiece and its LIVE!"
Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
"A handsome priest is sent by the Vatican to investigate mysterious goings-on in Seville, after a hacker breaks into the Pope's personal computer and issues a warning that a church there ""kills to defend itself."" The Church, ""Our Lady of Tears"" is slated for demolition, and two people involved in its potential closing have already been killed. Perez-Reverte provides long--I'd say overlong--descriptions both of his characters and of Seville, including, for example, list of the names of 27 bars in one section of the city. I read this book because it was on the list for my book-club. Maybe I'm just not enough of a mystery-lover, but it did nothing for me."
SNL deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how/why it matters/mattered. This is not that book. The author simply has no objectivity so he can't tell us the truth. If you want to read what you already know about the show's popular sketches this is the book to read. We learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together- or not- to make the show last this long. Far too little time is spent on the first 5 years and that first amazing cast. But if you want to hear about 'Pat' and Victoria Jackson this is the book for you. A real mess.
"Very strange to follow. Too much forward and backwards in the plot. Like the suspense, probably won't watch again.Too shifty."
"Since the moment I heard Clay on American Idol 2 I have loved his voice. This album shows just what this youg man can do, he can SING! The songs are powerful and sung to perfection by Clay. Every song is really great, and you will definitely listen to this album over and over. I don't see how anyone could not like it, it's just that good. This is one of the greatest, if not the grestest pop album of all time, Clay made a masterpiece!"
Pampers Baby Dry is a huge misnomer...they are terrible for urine intake! If your baby sleeps on their tummy through the night...YOU WILL WAKE UP WITH A WET BABY AND WET SHEETS/EVERYTHING!Use Pampers Swaddlers...at least until after size 3 as that is the largest size Swaddlers they make for some reason. You can thank me later. BABY DRY = WET BABY~~!!!

"yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert, bad quality or not. I'm only 16 and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity. I believe the Ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting, adrogyny is the only way to go!"
"The best part about the A-Team (besides no one getting hurt, the homemade weapons, the Team member's personalities, and the bad badguys) was the music. From the intro, to Face srenading his girl-du-jour, or Murdock talking to his invisible dog, to B.A. helping out at the Youth Center, to the raging firefights and homemade weapons, to the end credits, the music in A-Team was always appropriate for the setting, and always good. I love it when a soundtrack comes together!"

"I've had many problems with Sony computer items before, but I thought I'd give this one a try. After being on the phone with Sony (who didn't even know what the emarker was) for over four hours, I still can't the thing to work. There's some problem with the program you download from emarker.com. The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer. Thus, you can't use it at all. If I were you, I'd wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems. Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team, who would try to get back to me as soon as they can (I hope this team knows what the product is!)As for me, I plan on returning my emarker today."
"Compared to Shure's E2cs, the rival they're going for, it just doesn't match up. For almost the same price, they offer a higher noise isolation, i've compared them in outdoor environments."
This ring looks nothing like the picture. the diamonds are small and not very noticeable; I will be sending this back
"I am completely annoyed with this company. I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one. Instead of just sending me the right one, they are making me go through this ridiculous process by sending the other one back before they send the right one even though it was their mistake. It was supposre to be a christmas gift and basically it was ruined."
"I believe Al Ristori to be a well respected Fisherman who normally shares valuable information in a cut to the chase manner.But this book fails to live up to that reputation.It is definitely not a "" complete guide to Saltwater Fishing "".Almost all of the information presented in the book is cookie cutter and generic information that can easily be found on the net for free.This book was clearly not a labor of love and Al merely put his well know name on it to bank some coin......and has disappointed me in the process...."
"My family and I love Anne of Green Gables and cried through most of it.. we do not have a problem with the first 2... but............ we have been watching the series 1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen... I do not know what happen to Anne ( megan fellows) she was dead in every which way you look at it, no sparkal, no love no joy or happeness in her eyes or face at any time, she acted like a 50 year old women, we know she grew up but a person who has sparkle and joy and laughter in their eyes never loses that, and her voice in a few years has become deep and old.. we are so disappointed and so upset with this dvd... how can ones acting and joy be gone so fast... help"
I look forward to trying many of the recipes and really appreciate the nutritional information. However the information is based on a portion of the recipe such as 1/8 of recipe. This is really not helpful when the recipe is for a pot of soup. The soup would have to be divided into 8 servings to get an accurate calorie count. Even with that drawback I know I will enjoy some of the dishes.
"A classic, as always. In the today world of teaching tolerance and differences, this remains a good one to use in the classroom."
"This song when sung by Berlin was wondeful and not vocally overdone. Jessica Simpson sounds as if she is ripping her vocal chords out to hit some of the notes towards the end of the song. None of the remixed are particularly exciting and they all drag on without end. Unfortunetly, it seems as if this entire cd was rushed and hurried along; I would save my $$!"
"This book was an absolute joy to read. It immersed you into the characters. You felt totally attached to them. It let me in to a new aspect of the Civil War that I had never seen before...it was interesting and definitely not boring. This book is what I call a ""people-y"" book. She forms the characters so that they seem like real people, with real problems."
"Sad Sad SadThe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a much higher caliber actress, along with Liam Neeson's lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime.... almost as if the movies' set was haunted!The beginning of the movie has so much promise - you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise, you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer - then, and without warning, the silliness begins.It is as if you've been thrown into an Addams Family reunion - the story line starts to wander, the characters continue to wander, and ideas and solutions pop-up without a warning or explanation...To say a ""horror"" movie isn't believable almost sounds absurd, but this movie gets you suckered in, then throws you on the floor flat...This is a definite - do not buy, borrow or rent! Just wait for cable!"
very nice. easy to use. highly recommended. baby always seemed to manage to escape his blankets- this he can not get out of :)
"I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: ""Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)"".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD."
"This book is directed towards a certain type of women, to advise them them on how to act towards a certain type of man. Contrary to what it suggests, not all men are alike, no more than all women are alike. This book seems to categorize all men as chauvinists, and all women (at least the target audience) as dumb blonds. Doesn't necessarily work out that way. If you are having social issues of the sort that this book alludes to, you might want to see a counselor instead of taking advice from someone who is probably (as the title suggests), a Bitch!"
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, submitted for your consideration: ""The Predators,"" by Mark Washburn and Robert Webb (Stein and Day, 1984). From the jacket blurb:""The fiercest creature in the sea is the Great White Shark. The fiercest creature on land is the Kodiak Brown Bear. What happens when they are doomed by human predators to fight each other in the fiercest specatator sport ever imagined?Can human perversity encompass a combat between a twenty-foot Great White and a two-thousand-pound Kodiak for the sake of entertainment? Big-time promoter Augie Zisk is certain it can, and when the scheme is first brought to him he says only one word: cable. Ten million people will pay to watch an exhibition on television, and General Hidalgo de Carazonzo will be happy to host the show in his banana republic.""A neglected, and now hideously cannibalized, masterpiece.For shame, Mr. Bachelder. J'accuse!"
"The king of Crocodile Rock lost his teeth 25 years ago but here he is -again! - plugging away in geezer FM heaven. While old pharts may love the way John's campy cream puff crooning fluffs up their Depends, kids will absolutely hate this flaccidly-themed soundtrack of paint-by-number sugar pop fizz and bombastic lik-a-stik storytelling. Incredibly, The Road to El Doh!rado is worse than Elt's last Tim Rice collaboration AIDA, the 1999 multi-guest stinker currently being loaded in skeet machines around the world. Indeed, the only level this one works on is a cheap alternative for parents who want to sedate their hyperactive whippersnappers without having to shell out big bucks for a Ritalin prescription. Give it a rest Elton, for gawd's sake."
"The Devil Bat is a real poverty row effort from the 1940s, when Bela Lugosi was being offered roles of diminishing quality. That being said, it does have a certain campy charm,as Lugosi trains his electrically enlarged bats to kill at the scent of his special shaving lotion formula! The big bat has to be seen to be believed, and its attack cry is really something. All in all, a fun hour of viewing."
I guess I'm not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud.
"Very poor quality, blade feels blunt and scrapes rather than cuts..I used a whole pack of 8 in 1 week, each blade was only good for 1 shave. Dont waste your money"
"I first read this book many years ago and have reread it several times since, through my time at West Point, in the infantry and special forces. Now that I am retired I can safely say the characters rnig true, to include the bad ones. I recommend a couple of other books about the military if you are interested: Andy McNabb's SAS books which are #1 bestsellers in England and an excellent view into special operations-- the SAS wasn't that much different than SF. Closer to home I've enjoyed Bob Mayer's Special Forces series-- wish they were all in print-- as I had wished for years they'd resissue this book-- but you can get some here at Amazon."
"What makes this film truly great is how many different styles of comedy it has. You see not only slapstick and situation based comedy, but also some fabulous dialog and scare comedy. I didn't want to watch this movie at first, thinking it'd be a run of the mill b/w film, but was amazed, and immediately rewound and watched it a second time."
"Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters, it's all downhill. It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples. It's all theory. Don't waste your money and don't listen to all the fancy quotes on the book's back cover. This book just doesn't cut it."
"This is a terrible book. Julie Powell is, on her own admission, not a good cook and the text proves it. And on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either. I am accustomed to swearing (it is generally a substitute for vocabulary), but the use of foul language throughout is distasteful. Perhaps her moment of fame will inspire her. I doubt it. She should stick to blogging. Poor Julia - passe she may be, but she must be turning in her grave at this travesty."
I love the Cherry Poppin' Daddies...they're the best! Their songs are wonderful and they're sung beautifully.
I enjoyed this book a great deal. The story was very interesting and kept the reader guessing. I thought that many issues in the book were easy for students to relate to even today. The author didn't pull any punches in this startling work. I enjoyed this book and recommend it for students in sixth grade and up.
"My 5 year old son wanted this so bad, but when we got it for him, there were so many pieces to put together that didn't fit together well, he never played with it. It just sits on our floor in many pieces taking up toy space! What a waste!"
"Horrible and down right stupid Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which Includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work and effort, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch.The word of mouth is justified for this piece of garbage."
This Concordance has the SMALLEST print I've ever seen in ANY book!! Even with my reading glasses I have to squint in order to make out the print. I even tried a magnifying glass but gave up. I don't know who would able to use this book. I wasted my money since I can't even read it!!
Writer uses the war as filler while trying to pass off child molesting as romance. Couple doesn't get together until the end of the book. Big disappointment and some mistakes with Civil War history.
"Made by a Poverty Row studio in just six days, this cynical, acid-tongued noir exemplified what a skilled director like Ulmer could do on a shoestring budget. Narrated by Neal, whose weary voice is that of a man recounting a terrible nightmare, ""Detour"" wallows in grim fatalism and sports a wildly venomous turn by Savage, as the castrating vixen who blackmails Al into a seedy get-rich scheme. Crisp pacing, rabid dialogue, and on-the-fly camerawork make this disturbing and fascinating ""Detour"" well worth taking."
I think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work. My foot doctor recommended this to me and it's hard to find in local stores. It is stronger so watch you don't use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site. One tip my dr. gave me was to use a Q-Tip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart. That way you don't re-infect yourself! I would definately purchase this again.
"I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I have 8 big glasses in a blue color, but I'm wanting matching in a smaller glass and can't seem to find the same color. Anyway, I really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier. Also, these glasses are very stable, don't tip easily. Plus, they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy, that way they don't slip out of your hands as easily. I have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy, but I have never broken one of these."
"This author needs to stick to his normal genre. This was a good idea for a story line, but I felt like a 14 year old wrote it! I have read most of his other books and have enjoyed them, but I had to force myself to finish this one."
"Ok..... Chop suey is the only good song on this cd.. if u expect that this cd will be like there Last LP that's where your wrong.. they seem to have a christian\gospel touch...insted more of a heavy metal\rock touch... if u want some real metal\rock try Slipknot,Static-x,Disturbed,Slayer,pentara and more artists like that."
I was given our first book by Sandra Boynton as a gift when my daughter was just 6 months old. I have since then bought several more of her books and my daughter loves each.and.every.one of her books that we own! Sandra Boynton's books were literally the first books that really caught my daughter's attention and we read them every day. She is almost 8 months old now and I think she'll love them as she grows older as well. I highly recommend any of her books!
"My copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture! Talk about lousy merchandising. No Dolby, much less DTS, only a PCM Stereo recording. Video is average. Like proper packaging and presentation were no more than an afterthought.All in all, this looks like a bootleg edition. And no, it's an official release. Amazing. Messy. What were they thinking?"
"I've only ever walked out of one movie, and this was it. I actually stayed for an hour, hoping it'd get better...but it actually got worse. The acting: bad, the stunts: bad, the plot: VERY bad. I wouldn't wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies (even thogh I have none). Save your money, send it to Sally Struthers or something."
"This book doesn't contain mathematical formula which is a plus for me!The explanation on how a statistic can be misunderstood or misrepresent in simple English.It is helpful because I can spot more loopholes in statistics now.On the other hand, if a need arises. I can use these methods to mislead people!"
"I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"
"Everytime I see this film, I get so glad that I dropped out of Law School. Kingfield is alive, well and lurking out there. If you are thinking about going to Law School, see this film if you have time between reading canned briefs. The ""Little Questions that tumble in your brain are really there. The Stress over grades is real, the classmates who crash & burn are real. I can not recommend this film too highly to potential 1Ls."
This movie depicts the real lives of teens grouwing up in nyc. I live in nyc and i have seen all of this going on. The only way to protect todays youth is to scare the hell out of them with movies like this.
I first got this album in 1992. I was immediately hooked. This album is a cornerstone of music that the dirty dozen brass band have helped bring back to the spotlight. One of my all time favorites.
"A terrific read. Very dry, engaging, and clips along at a good pace. I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage. M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of ""getting by."" Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life. ""Effect"" instead of ""Cause."" The story begins with a death, and ends with a death. In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's ""fiancee"" or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes. Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon. Be ""Cause."" Not ""Effect."" Get out and LIVE. Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply ""getting by.&quot"
"...of those bands whose latest work disappoints me. If like me, you were expecting more 'sorry about tomorrow' then steer clear. This just wasn't *ahem* 'rocking' enough for my tastes - and felt like a real step backwards (contrary to the other reviews) I don't think they will return to their higher energy material, which for me is a shame, as I was a fan."
Very informative for the novice Genealogist. Helpful hints of where to look for information both online and in the library.
"Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about ""breaking with reality"", and her book serves as an adequate example of what can happen when someone does become reality impared; it contains no real facts to support her claims that Dungeons and Drangons had any thing to do with any deaths what so ever, and what ""facts"" she does offer are either falsely described or out right lies. I agree that if you are a bad parent you should probably error on the side of caution and limit the activities of your little monster, but I think ""not keeping guns in the house"" and ""not letting your child butcher pets"" (both things Mrs Pulling admits she or her son did) should come well before stopping them from playing D&D. Besides if you get rid of D&D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone?"
This book really sucks. It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time. Ray should have had better things to do
This book has changed my life. It opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery. I'm want to buy copies to away give to people in my life.
"It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View."
"Thefirst volume of Gasarakireally surprised me. It was well written and thoughtful, trying to tell a deep story that was more about behind the scenes power plays than robot brawls.This second disc continues to add new wrinkles and complications. The war with Belgistan comes to a close (which surprised me as I thought it was going to run through the entire series) and the JSSDF forces prepare to pull out. We learn about a secret organization calling itself Symbol that was assisting Belgistan, though their motivations for doing so are still clouded.Yushiro causes some commotion when he heads off base and winds up in the middle of a kidnapping. We also see more of the mysterious girl from the first disc that seems to share Yushiro's powers.Very little seems to happen episode by episode. If the disc is watched straight through it is very satisfying viewing, but I can see that if I were watching this half an hour at a time as it was broadcast it would have been tough to follow."
"I was a great fan of the Mr. Coffee MUG-ACTIVATED warmer. The ones I had finally gave out so I looked to buying more, and some for friends. I could find only the ""on/off switch"" warmer (although it was initially called ""mug-activated"" on the screen) so ordered 2. As already stated, the coffee is kept only warm, and you definitely have to remember to turn OFF the warmer or you could return hours later and find it still ON, which could be a danger. I have been unable to find a mug-activated warmer, but continue the search because I do not believe this ""on/off switch"" is any good."
"The Oregon Trail is an undeniable classic -- although overrated compared to other books written about the same time about the same subject. Parkman is a priggish, Boston snob who complains his way across the West. He despises the pioneers crossing the plains and has no interest in them -- a startling lack of consciousness for a historian. The Indians and the mountain men fare little better. A better, more generous book by a young man in the west is Wah-to-Yah and the Taos Trail by Lewis H. Garrard.Smallchief"
This product is shown in its picture setup with a top. There is no top with this product and there are no supports or framework of any kind to set it up with. What you get is a white folded cloth in a bag.
"I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it. I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist, Muersault. Forget existentialist - this man was depressed. He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence. It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently not in good health and they weren't close. But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed. It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder. More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood. There were some serious mental health issues that this man had."
"The only thing really wrong with Morse is that he smokes too much. If you want a really good read in your mysteries, here it is."
"I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history."
"When I had first heard of the book, I thought it would be a ridiculously confusing science fiction fantasy book that was not worth the trouble of reading. However, I gave in and checked it out form the library after my curiousity rose when I saw its unpublished sequel being sold on amazon. I am very glad I did. Eragon staisfied my appetite for a good, decent, and understandable story about dragons, and Eragon and Saphira. I enjoyed the plot development and the creativity Paolini put into making the story and its world seem real and fascinating. I wait patiently and curiously for the second book of the trilogy, Eldest, which I hope will be as good or exceed Eragon. Loved it and recommend it to all fantasy-genre lovers. Enjoy!"
"Although she might say she's not,it's painfully obvious.Hoku is ""another dumb blond"". The only reason she gets those 5-star reviews is cuz people are so tired of dumb blond singers that they want to believe thet she's different.She danses like a moose."
"This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's ""Prose Edda"", which is one of the clearest sources on Nordic Mythology, it must also be kept in mind that Snorre was writing several hundred years post Heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of Mythological models. In short, Snorre's work reads like Greek myth with Nordic characters. Not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on Heathen belief, he was writing a handbook on poetry, particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference. Snorre's work is useful as a secondary reference at best, and if Snorre got it wrong, and a book (this one) is based on Snorres works.... well... you get the picture."
I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read. If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list. Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure. I finished the book and was still waiting for something to happen. Dont waste your time
"Awesome movie, story, acting, etc. The blu ray quality was good, but not blown away 5 stars great. I, too, could see the arrows in the beginning, plus different markings on the packaging so i'm assured it is the remastered version."
"Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size and fit are horrible. The fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the flat sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again."
I have had the case for a month now and I am very happy with it so far. The case holds my TX nicely. No problems with the belt clip either. Very good product for the price.
"A regular nail biter: strong plotlines, excellent cast give relaible performances, killer locations. Sci-fi what-if horror flick with a twist. Who knew Tim Hutton was a sci-fi fan? Nice uncomplicated performance.,"
"It has been a while since I last got excited about a book, but this book inspired me. This book gives both rational arguments for Christianity and sound explanations of core Christian doctrines."
An Awesome book because it is full of many heroes and many villians in the marvel universe.
The grandkids loved this one. Not only did they get the favorites but the set included several the family had not seen!
"I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.Kind of like Buford Pusser in ""Walking tall"" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun."
"This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's ""How to get control of time and your life"", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background."
"I bought two of the 633's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that, not the manufacturers). After a year and a half the first one stopped working. Best I can tell, the Hard Drive just failed. The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it. A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also. I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives. I am waiting until pioneer replaces this line (533/633) to buy a better one. Don't know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product."
"I love David Sedaris. I think his writing is very funny, very touching and very entertaining. I go to see Sedaris speak when he's on tour and I read short pieces he's written for The New Yorker and Esquire online. In fact, I've already read many of the stories in this book (which was somewhat disappointing). ""Rooster at the Hitching Post"" and several other have been printed elsewhere and you can read them online if you don't want to buy this book. I will say, though, there are plenty of new stories in here that make the book well worth it. Just don't be too surprised if you come across something you've read before."
"I had to read this for my AP English class. At first, it didn't catch my attention, but to my english teacher's urging (Mrs. Brodmerkel) I read on. Actually, if she wasn't there to explain each chapter after we had read it, it wouldn't have been As good. This was a great book, and I think everyone should have to read it. There are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today. Dickens does well in making this novel timeless."
"I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor, he told me to email him to remind him to fix it, but he didn't ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again."
"I find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating. If this gets five stars, what do good films get?!. This makes no sense. The film is poor. Hre are a few thoughts...Acting: I've seen better acting in fifth grade musicals.Plot: Plot, what plot?Dialog: Laughable.Character Development: The characters are so static that I felt like I was watching a soap opera set in 1930s Egypt in which many things arbitrarily exploded.I will praise this film in one way: it is better than Hollow Man (but then again, sitting in an empty parking lot watching a dumpster for 90 minutes is more satisfying than watching Hollow Man). In closing, my solemn hope is that the mummy won't return again."
This item was bigger than expected which was a very nice surprise. It has lasted for several years used by one boy then passed on to his younger brother when he was interested in looking a bugs. It is easy to store on a shelf and find when suddenly a bug springs up that a boy wants to take a closer look at. the mesh cover is somewhat transparent but the best view is from the clear acrylic door not the side. No bug has ever accidentally escaped yet.
I don't understand why people adore Patterson. His lame dialogue is beyond tedious. This one could have been written by a teenager.
"No, I'm not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say ""nearly,"" because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I'm not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties. Unbelievable..."
"If you can get past the cover and inside photos --- a Humper who looks suspiciously surgically streamlined --- you will be for a warm, fuzzy surprise. The Humper still has it: smooth vocals with a blend of country and pop and the softest of rock possible, all showcased with his three-and-a-half octave range. There are covers --- ""Volare,"" ""Penny Lane"" (perhaps an homage to The Beatles, the group whom he knocked off the charts with his No. 1 hit, ""Release Me""), ""If Tomorrow Never Comes,"" ""This Guy's in Love With You"" and the underrated Aznavour anthem ""She."" There's an infectious taste of calypso with ""Brazil,"" and a truly likable country-flavored "" How Slow We Go,"" co-written by the Humper's daughter, Louise. The best track is the title track, ""Definition of Love"" --- proof, indeed, that the man still defines love. Now a bad way to celebrate 35 years in the business of making love on the record."
"All I can say is AMAZING. This novel is incredible. The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film, it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it's a brand new story and it really doesn't ruin either one. Please keep in mind that it IS a 19th century novel, so you'll have to wade through some serious romantic protestations, but they do not take away from the action. Definately worth reading...and FREE on Kindle. Thank you Kindle!"
"This is an oustanding product, i love the quality of the picture and sound. if you are a spiderman fan, blu-ray is the way to go! I highly recommend this product!"
Couldn't get enough channels (even with purchase of an external antenna) to make it worth the price.
i love this movie more than love itself. it is one of the most amazing movies ever made period. BUT the quality of this blu ray is garbage. wait until the re-release or just get the DVD ...to bad it looks so awful...great movie
"When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong, self-assured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing. I have given this book to my sisters and to several friends. And whenever I get into a discussion about 'good books' this is one of the books I bring up and strongly encourage every I know to read.Today I have come to shop for this book so that I might send it to a pen-pal in West Africa. He wants me to send him books that will assist him in speaking better english. And this was the first book I thouht to send him. Well that and a dictionary.Thanks to Jean Auel for writing such a great novel."
"This material represents why the 80's died, the music is bland and poppy, the Wilson sister's garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten."
"This product makes a copy of the new disk from old disk. But it is not bootable using the EZ GIG 2 software. I have Dell Media Experiance but not Dell Media direct. After trying for two weeks and researching I got hold of tech support, really. Waited on hold for 45 min. After talking with them. I was told it does not work for the dell 700/710m laptops. So now instead of using my new 120GB drive to replace my 80 GB drive. I have another 120GB external drive. But it does have all my files and programs.Sadly it was a waste of money."
"Great history of the company, but I was disappointed in the little milk glass content. The author talks about how important the opal (milk) glass line was for business, but does not offer much samples of it in the book."
"The Quality is tenth rate, this DVD is almost unwatchable and the audio sucks."
"This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though ""O please get over yourself"". I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time."
"Very disappointed with this item! First, when the knife arrived it obviously had been a return from someone else because the plastic was sliced open and the knife had been removed before. But, my son really wanted this for Christmas, so I kept it because I had not been able to find another one anywhere else. It was a Christmas present, and the leather sheath broke on Christmas Day after wearing it only about 5 hours! However, my son was very happy with the knife, so now we are trying to find another sheath for it."
"The usual Girl Goes To The Big City cliches, not as bad as what you'd expect from Mr. Bruckheimer, thanks to the lovely and charismatic Ms. Perabo and a nice performance from Mr. Goodman as ""Dad""...still, a gal who aspires to write songs and has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY. That whole Whitney/Mariah thing, yecch.The bar scenes have a certain energy to 'em, but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams (or personalities).Here's hoping the adorable Piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future. I will definitely be following her career."
"What a great voice and masterful delivery of material. Someone else wrote sexy with a capitol S but that is insufficient. I'm not a big jazz fan and I guess this is not classic jazz but some sub-genre that really turns me on. Somehow the instrumentation, which is good, fades into the backround because Christy's voice is so present and distinctive. I can't tell you how many times I've played this cd and chosen it over my favorite classic rock. Its a great album to enjoy when you're happy just being by yourself and also a very nice listen when you're with someone special. I'm so glad I found some other music by her and I surely hope there is more comming. By the way, it has a couple of cuts that don't feature her and they are interesting and don't detract from the album. Also, I read in one of her bios that she starred in an indie movie called Pants on Fire. You can bet I'll be watching that if I can locate it."
"If you want to shoot bbs at your room mate indoors, this is definitely the way to go. Has a ridiculous rate of fire, which is faster than the Pulse M74, but it is also weaker than the Pulse M74. The hopper doesn't hold as many bbs as it should, however (~70)."
"Tego es la fuerza en la musica latina. Es una tremenda mezcla de son, salsa, reggaeton y hip-hop. Que estupendo!!!!!!!"
"Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black, Boiler Room,and so on. I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie. It was long and dry. The funny parts were few and far between, and there was sooo much action in it that it was almost UNBEARABLE to watch. Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes. It leaves u drained. NOT VIN DIESELS FINEST HOUR I WILL SAY.."
My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo. Plug and play.
"Book of John is my favorite of the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ's ministry on earth. I like the mix of what is historically known about the apostle John with the fictional story to fill in and make an interesting read. Then The Gospel of John and the 3 Epistles written by John are also included at the end of the book.Have also read the other ""Jesus Chronicles"" by same authors about Matthew, Mark, and Luke. I recommend all of them.Love being able to download books to the Kindle App on my Toshiba Thrive Tablet."
"This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies, you're dumber than I thought Americans ever would be. Kerry didn't do any more than any of our boys are doing out there every day, and less than most. I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it."
"Ben Hur, Spartacus, even the ever tantilizing Roma...no other film of the Roman Epic class will ever compare to the beauty and splendor that is found in Gladiator. Russell Crowe is one of the few leading men who truely fits the Strong Silent role perfectly, while horribly tradgic, the movie astounds me every time I watch it. You will need to nuke 2 or 3 bags of popcorn prior to the movie, you will be too captivated to get up for food let alone to pause the film."
I admit I did not read the back of this CD carefully. I happily bought it and popped it into the CD player anticipating the wonderful tunes I had heard throughout the movie. But my favorites weren't there. The most important missing item? It's Tough To Be A God as sung by the stars of the movie. Elton John's duet with Randy Newman just isn't as much fun. It's not a bad album really. I was just disappointed.
"A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended."
"I had bought all the DVDs up to season 4 and was dissapointed that they stopped issuing the seasons. All in al, the features are the same as the other seasons and the dvd's are a must have for any fresh prince fan!"
I saw this movie way back when it came out in the theaters but that was so long ago so when I seen it on Amazon I had to get it to see if it was as good as i remember it and it was better. I tell you it is hard to even take it from the player. I think it's really good. Dennis Hopper does a great job as Koopa and the Mario Bros. are great. And for those of you who might think that the princess's name should be Peach not Daisy you are a little off the page. The character of Daisy first shows up in Super Mario Land as Luigi's girl while Peach is Mario's. DUH!!
"Showed this film to my French class, and it was a hit. The same actors as in Jean de Florette, but about 20 years later. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"As other reviews, band around ball showing the exercises is unnecessary and not nice looking. Functions well, no problem with the pump. Use it as an alternative desk chair."
"We love the Water Boy water dish.No longer constantly mopping up after our dog drinks. We have given one to our daughter for her dog and she loves it.We are buying more for other family dogs and want a spare for us when the summer comes,heard you can fill half way and freeze so it's ready for a hot day or just a hike through the park."
We received this book as a gift. I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing. There are so many better books out there to spend your money on.
"I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read."
"Wordcraft: New English to Old English Dictionary and ThesaurusIf you only know Shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be King Henry IV part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing. Barbara Hodgdon has done an amazing job editing this play and her notes are extremely helpful besides her explication of this play there are historical graphics and historical maps that will help you when reading or seeing the works of Shakespeare. This book is more than a college textbook, it is enjoyable historical reading. Craig Barr."
"... Although this movie has a few moments that will bring a smile to your face (the same kind of smile you get as you pass gas), it is certainly not among the best comedic efforts of all time-.......A much better film in the same vein would be Bruce Robinson's HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING <Criterion Collection>(Executively produced by George Harrison)...Even some episodes of the Drew Carey show, and the old Mary Tyler Moore TV Series are better than this film!"
"I was the ""nice girl"" before reading this book. This book has helped me so much when it comes to dating. I find myself being happier in relationship than ever before. If you give to much to any man in your life I STRONGLY suggest that you buy this book you won't regret it. I'm even going to buy this book for my closest girlfriends. Before dating another guy read this book he will help you out tremendously."
"Most of the young stars here perform very well in a high production western that is'nt quite as good as the sum of it's parts. Wagner is'nt bad, Debra Paget is good as always but Jeff Hunter is slightly miscast, though he works quite hard. I liked the feel of time and place this film has and it still retains a sweep and grandour which must have looked great on its original cinema outing.What else can I say. I thoroughly enjoyed it even with its shortcommings and can recommend it even on repeated viewings though widescreen works best for the full-bodied western vistas."
"Seriously, I cannot fathom that people gush over this book.Essentially, what IDENTITY CRISIS was supposed to be was a 'whodunnit' for the DC Universe stable of characters. However, in a world of telepaths, sorcerers and men who shoot laser beams out of their eyes it falls embarrassingly flat on its face. Meltzer composes a story full of plot holes, bad characterization, and enough tired cliches to make any true fan of the genre wince.Quite possibly the only good comment I could make is that the artist is quite talented... other than that, not a lot to recommend."
I just finished it and I've got a great big smile on my face. It starts out slow but by the end you want more. Thats half the fun imagining what will be next. If your the earthy type this series is a must read. My all time favorite set of books. Get the series and set off on the adventure of a lifetime. If the next one is truely the last please please make it twice as long.
"Exactly what I wanted, will reorder when I run out. Came fresh and makes the best tea. Thank you very much.."
"They have that unmistakable beet like their fathers. Which is always good to hear. But they have managed to do create a new style, whch is what makes this one ""mortal"". As soon as I saw them do one of their songs on TV, I went out to buy it. I wasn't disappointed. It is extremely danceable. I also love the name and what it means."
"This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence."
"If you love Paul Williams and if you love Dylan this is an unbeatable experience, focusing as it does on what some might call ""lost years"" of highs and lows of Bob's career. It is all the same for Paul Williams who takes it ALL in and lovingly dissects every speck of Dylan's output. Paul Williams was a lone voice in the wilderness back in the ""Dylan: What Happened"" days so this serves as an extension of that important book."
"This thing is ok. But realize, you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work. Therefore you need 2 people to blow out your pipes. When you are blowing out an rv, constant air pressure is the key. So, saying that, i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it. Now I just screw this on, attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and I no longer need to hold it in place."
"Less than three months after purchase, it's in the shop; an authorized repair center. Picture started ""snapping"" 'till no more picture. They replaced the picture tube and something else. I took it home. Then, it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen. They've been working on it for a week ..."
"I bought this particular case for my CO2 pistol and was able to get the pistol, 5 co2 cartridges and one 350 count bb tube into it."
"I think this book should be made compulsory reading in schools. It is defiantly one of the great classics. It is timeless, it is still as good today as the day it was first released. I have read few books that would match up to this one. This book can be read by all ages and by people in all warps off life and can be enjoyed by all. I would recommend this book to any one and hope that all have the satisfaction of reading it."
I bought this unit after my Linksys wireless router died; I can therefore only compare it to the Linksys.Setup was EXTREMELY quick and easy. I got it up and running in just a few minutes. The UI of the admin app is very straight forward and I notice is strangely similar to the UI of SMC routers. I find it to be somewhat easier to work with than the Linksys UI.I am unfortunately not pleased with the transmission range of this router. I placed it in the exact same location that the Linksys had been in. A computer that was getting solid 100% connection strength with the Linksys is now only getting 50% with this unit. Another machine that was getting around 70% on the Linksys would not connect at all to this unit until it was moved to a different location.This would be an excellent unit were it not for the range problem... Perhaps there's a fix?
"This is a great bathroom reader. I find that the references to geographical locations as the word names a bit off, but I imagine inventing new words would be quite challenging."
"How could you not love it? The double set saves half the storage space. A ""must"" for any Kim Carnes fan."
"I'm disappointed like the rest. I bought the VHS version several years ago and expected an exact copy of it on the DVD. WRONG!!! To make matters worse the DVD cover says ""Running Time: Approx. 90 minutes"" The ACTUAL running time is 55 minutes. What a rip-off!!"
"I love this book. Not just because I used to love making cookies with my mom years ago, but the variety of cookies make this book one of the best. Highly recommended."
"I had to quickly find a dress to go to a wedding, and I was distressed by how little I could find in my size readily available on the web or in stores. Amazon was the last place I looked and this is the first thing that popped up, and it's perfect. It fits, it's appropriate, and it's cheap and fast. If you're plus size and tearing your hair out over how slim the pickings are [especially if you have an ounce of taste and don't like the traditional plus size color palette/prints], this is your solution. Also, the only alternatives I found were all ""special order at least two months ahead"" gowns. Hello, who does anything two months ahead any more? If time is not a luxury you can afford, this is your solution as well."

"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, THE QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE,BUT ITS GREAT TO WATCH AFTER ALL THESE YEARS"
"No, no, no! What went wrong? Big-budget film with great actors, and what do we get? A visually appealing film with a completely flat Liam Neeson and a paper-thin storyline. Catherine Zeta Jones tries to charm her way through, but even though she does an okay job, the movie is still bad. Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all, but cannot manage to save the day. All we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content. It all seems to be over before it really begins, and nothing really makes much sense. And the eerie mood is almost totally absent. Not a good omen for a ""horror"" movie, is it?I just can't believe what went wrong for Neeson. Usually he drags a movie up, not down! Watch House on Haunted Hill instead, if you're into ""stuff-some-people-into-a-haunted-house-and-see-if-the-survive"" movies. Then you'll se how a proper haunting should be :)"
"You would think that a DVD with an alluring girl on the cover and had the word ""SEX"" in the title would well, have SEX in the actual movie. But, you'd be completely wrong if you bought Phone Sex Fantasies because there is NO sex, real or simulated in the entire DVD! Basically, the girls talk dirty (sorta) and then take off their clothes. That's it."
"Moby's latest album touches on many genres of music, and it sounds fantasctic. Instantly recognisable tunes hit you, and no wonder companies are queueing up to have his music play on their adverts. One of the best things about play is the number of songs on the album, a massive 18! It is guarenteed that everyone will like most of the tunes, because of the contrast in styles. If you buy one album this year, MAKE IT THIS ONE"
Love. Love. LOVE this book! It has basically everything. Like a wiccan/ pagan dictionary. Of course You wouldnt read it from cover to cover. You could. But i wouldnt suggest it. But thats good! it means theres tons upon tons of info! It's great!
Love the quality of the movieI have a high def wide screen tvwent to the ROOT MENUthe audio had an echo like the sound in a movie theatreAdjusted the audio from Theatre to Living Room and that corrected the musicBUT I still got the echo on my tv for the talkingI played it on my computer--and worked very wellI will have to deal with my tv later! It readjusted the whole tv system.Ah the good old days before HD and all that jazz!There must be a sound adjustment I haven't adjusted yet.
"Every recipe I have tried thus far has been either 1) bland or 2) outright disgusting. I need to throw this book away before I waste more time and money on disastrous recipes.Silken Chocolate pie: NastyBlack Bean Dip: TastelessSkinny Dip: I cant believe this is considered food.One plus is that it inspired some great dishes. Since I don't eat eggs, high protein breakfasts are hard to come by. I made a tofu veggie casserole (not following the book's recipe, but rather the general concept) and it came out wonderful...but all in all this book has been a waste of money- beyond the purchase and shipping costs."
Ease of use - excellentBattery life- lasted a flight to/from Hawaii and still in useDecreased cabin noise - good (nothing else to compare it to)Sound quality - very goodPrice - not as expensive as Bose
"Even if you accept the basic premise of this movie, a re-connection between long dead fireman father and still grieving policeman son via ham radio, you will find something profoundly illogical in some of the individual scenes. That doesn't prevent it from being extremely moving thanks to beautiful flat-out emotional performances by Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and flawlessly cast supporting actors. Look for an extraordinarily moving fire rescue scene. Some of the suspense set pieces worked into the story are superb.This film definitely overcomes its narrative flaws.Walmer Road in Toronto puts in a fine appearance as a street in Queens, N.Y."
"DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST. IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER, JUST SO THAT YOU HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING!"
"As a long-time Douglas Adams fanatic (read all 5 of the trilogy, at least a dozen time, even wrote down every noun in all 5 for a database,) I read both Last Chance to See and DGHDA and loved them. Then I read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I'd ever encountered. I didn't laugh once and literally had to force myself through it with several lapses between readings. Odin and Thor bored me senseless. I can now understand why there's been no third addition to the series. Time wasted on this could have been much better spent working on yet another HHG novel."
"A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special ""special effects"" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting. The only thing that's scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after 30 years. The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it."
Hey readers out there. I just looked this book up because the November 24 edition of the Los Angeles Times ran the true amazing story of this incident. I guess now I'll have to read the book. When I do I'll come back with my review. You can get the LA Times on-line.
Save youself some money. The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste. They actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from Jawbone.I was even more disappointed that I paid $4.63 shipping on a worthless $9.99 product. It's not even worth returning. Lesson learned. Hopefully you will also.
"I've owned my pair for close to four years now and they are starting to physically deteriorate. The sound quality is excellent, as is the noise canceling. I used these in an office cubicle environment and later in a computer room, and the performance on my iPod is outstanding. But at this point the plastic upright on each earphone has broken and needs to be held together with wire ties, and the rubber cover on one of the ear pieces has worn through. Granted, I use them almost every day, but they don't see rough use - and this isn't the type of endurance I'd expect from a $300 product. The two year warranty isn't long enough to address these issues.UPDATED JANUARY 2009One of the ear pieces finally cracked at the pivot point and simply fell off. When I contacted Boise they did offer to replace them with a new set for $100."
"Another fine adaptation (though you get the sense that they could have added in more). The students are growing up, the stakes are getting higher, and this, of course, features the full return of Voldemort. And of course there's the character played by an actor doomed to play that infernal pasty white sparkly vampire in the years to come. Where's a Voldemort or Wormtail in those Twilight films when you really need a sparkly vampire dispatched anyway?"
"Great product at great price (69.99 with free delivery). I recently purchased a panasonice upconverting dvd player and although the video, remote on that player is great the build quality is sub par compared to this player. glad to have this dvd player after having great experience with pioneer laser disc back in the day. usb input a huge plus. Great video. Don't hesitate."
"Before reading this book,I had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting. This book is akin to beauty bound in pages, it is utterly amazing. I personally do not understand why people say it is difficult to understand and even more difficult to get through. I couldn't put it down, it simple spoke to me. Rules to follow while reading this: 1.) Pay attention and savor, and 2.) Open your mind"
"I breastfed my daughter until she was a year old and found the Boppy to be pretty much useless. It wasn't the right height for nursing for me and I preferred to use a smaller pillow which conformed to my daughter's body better.We used it once or twice for sitting up, but most of the time, she was supported by my legs or multiple pillows. I think this is one of those products that's either love/hate--for us, it has to be the latter!"
"The hallmarks are all there--the air of virtue and innocence, the first love quickly disillusioned, jealousy, backbiting, a second romance that proves to be the reason for living--yes, we will someday see some actress playing Mary Boleyn on the Lifetime channel in ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" That's all this novel is fit for. Mary Boleyn is the most bovine ""heroine"" I've ever encountered, and Philippa Gregory's writing never gets above the Weepie of the Week level. The Boleyns are a fascinating subject for fiction; they aren't served well or made interesting by Gregory's book..."
"This is the third installment in a series of dramatizations of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved Anne of Green Gables novels. Megan Follows and Jonathon Crombie return in their usual roles. Unfortunately, this third production does not meet the high standards set by the first, faithful installment. In a total of seven Anne novels, Montgomery provided fully enough amusing, sentimental, and unabashedly romantic material for three movies. It was a pity that the second production (Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel) departed somewhat from the novels; it's a crime that this third production leaves Montgomery behind entirely, transporting her characters forward in time, pitchforking them into a trite war plot, and resolving the incoherent plot elements with a tepid, candy-coated ending."
"The pump sounded like a good deal--SOUNDED is the word that needs to be taken into account here. I bought the pump for a reef aquarium. Before I installed the pump all I could here was the trickle of water from the other pumps. Turned this one on, and I thought I was in the middle of the freeway. LOUD!!! Other reviewers had said it was loud--I should have listened. I will be returning it this week. HyperFlow--It should be named HyperSound"
This was a very funny movie. I saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought. The guys that gave it 3-5 stars definitely got it right. I was reading the 1-star reviews and just got pissed off. What's wrong with people? What were you expecting from this movie? It was loaded with hilarious scenes. You got these clowns bad mouthing the movie I suppose because I guess it wasn't a groundbreaking thought provoking movie. Get out of your own asses
"Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead."
"What the f**k is this? The TV show was funnier than this garbage! People who doesn't have seen this movie, DON'T SEE IT! It's a yasste of time and money!"
"Garbage deliver more terrific euro-trash rock on their second album, 1998's ""Version 2.0"". Another mix of crunching guitars, wild beats, groovy keyboards & effects, and the sensual voice of Shirley Manson, the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock, with such great, rockin' tracks as ""Temptation Waits,"" ""I Think I'm Paranoid,"" ""Push It,"" and my personal fave, ""Sleep Together."" There's also playful pop-rock with ""Special"" (with Shirley tipping her hat to the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde at the end), the delirious ""Hammering In My Head,"" and the truly gorgeous ""You Look So Fine."" Fabulous music & production from a fabulous band, ""Version 2.0"" is essential Garbage."
"After roughly a year of fairly reliable use, I've also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack. Now i'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago (""limited"" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider ""fixing"", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would've given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I'm outright angry that I'm not alone."
"my baby is 10 months old and fits very comfortable in this, the fabric that covers it is great quality and is very flexible and easy to inflate, but not to easy to fold back in the original shape to fit in the bag."
"It is a very good book. I learned some interesting things, but I guess the subject is more deep. I found the book a little incomplete."
"Now, I am a HUGE fan of Jack Off Jill, My Ruin, Otep ect... And those chicks can scream. However, the vocalist of Sugarcoma fails to make the music enjoyable with her weak screaming. The singers oj JOJ, MR, Otep ect... Put power behing their music and make it enjoyable. Sugarcoma just makes it annoying. She does have a nice singing voice, and the band is very talented. I think Sugarcoma would be better off if she didnt scream..."
There is only one word for this CD - - -DELICIOUS ! ! ! ! Went back and bought two more for friends. They agreed with me. ENJOY
I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.
"Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of ""Billy the Kid"" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy."
"Ordered this set for my grandma, it showed up 3 days before christmas and the main perfume bottle was cracked and had leaked every where.Wouldnt recommend buying from the seller, should have just went to jcpenny in the first place."
"We received this as a wedding gift. Three years later it looks like new! It cleans easily, cooks wonderfully, and has a great weight to it. I've never had a teflon pan last so long without any signs of wear or tear. This is probably the wedding gift we have used more than all others, and I couldn't be more satisfied."
"Did Richard III have the princes in the Tower ""done in?"" That is one of the great mysteries of history, and Tey ""solves"" it in the Daughter of Time. Some critics consider this the greatest mystery novel ever written, and I concur. Have read hundreds of mysteries, many of them marvelous,but The Daughter of Time is the best.There are those who think Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is best. I don't because I had correctly figured out who the murderer was by page 2."
"Hi,I bought this book sometime last month. Received it couple of weeks back. It was delivered promptly, but the book print quality seems to be bad. In fact it looks like a fake! Looks more like a photocopy of the original book. So much for paying this kind of money to buy the 'original'."
"if you're considering buying this album i'd say you'd probably enjoy it, but if you have any respect for yourself and the people around you please forget it and buy something less terrible."
"The best sax player of his generation joined by one of the best pianists ever. This is Getz last recording, and some of his solos are almost unbearably sad. His lyrical inventiveness was never greater though. Getz doesn't embellish the original melody in his solos. He makes comletely new ones of even greater beauty. Here they are often plaintive and full of pain. Jazz artists rarely display this sort of emotional openess. But Getz's technnical skills and Romantic imagination turn all this into high art. Barron, of course, is simply the best jazz pianist around. Together they have produced a truly great album."
"After having numerous store-bought scales, always thinking, Geez, I don't weigh that much or WOW,I lost a few,only to find out the scale was the culprit. The adjusting wheel would only ""Zero"" the dial, and not correct the problem. The Detecto ""physicians scale""Detecto 437 Balance Beam Doctor/Physician Scale, 400 lbs, Made in the USAis just what I was looking for. After an easy assembly and adjustment I checked the accuracy by putting various weights on the platform, from 25#s to 250#s and it was ""right on"". I wish I would have bought this sooner, and it's ""Made in the USA"" !!!!"
"This DVD is a disgrace. Pathetic. It's actually an outstanding film of an Allman Brothers concert, but the producers ruined it by interrupting the songs with interviews. How can they be so stupid? How can the members of The Allman Brothers allow the record company to butcher the songs like that? Don't they have enough interest in their own music to pay attention to what gets released? If you want to see the full length versions of the songs in this concert, buy the VHS version because it's all there. As for the DVD release, it's such a shame that corporations and record labels show such disrespect for music. The Allman Brothers are one of the greatest live bands of all time and there isn't very much concert footage that has been released, so why did they have to ruin this wonderful concert?"
"I have read most, if not all, of Grishams books and this one was by far the worst!! I've actually stopped reading it about 3/4 the way through because i have ZERO interest in finishing it. It is very boring, has no suspense, and jumps around a lot. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did."
"This is alright for a beginner but, I hope his next book improves greatly, otherwise I will not even bother to read the third one.One thing that bugs me about this book is that the author seemed to keep changing his mind about almost everything! For instance, his dragon. She keeps almost changing shape! She's supposed to be so huge and strong but can't carry three people. She flies way up in the air one day, but the next day she can't breathe that high. It makes no sense. Its as if the author keeps switching from one story to another.I don't think it was written well."
Like the other Doctor Kracker Snack I reviewed they are as hard as a rock. Reminds me of pasteboard with cheese flavoring.
The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.
"After reading reviews about every small wine cellar offered through Amazon, I ordered this item, hoping it would work. It arrived damaged. The cellar was sent UPS in just its original box, no extra packing to protect it. The plastic around the door was cracked. The door was also hanging at an angle. I actually considered keeping it even with the damage so I plugged it in and tested the temperature with a refrigerator thermometer. No matter what setting I put it on, the temperature remained at a constant 42 degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine. Amazon made the return easy. They sent UPS to my house to pick up the item. I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again. I finally ordered a Magic Chef wine cellar through Home Depot. It arrived well packed and seems to be working just fine."
I was looking for a small silver ring and this one was perfect. It exceeded my expections because the ring was not expensive at all. It is true to size and if you want a ring that sparkles quite a bit this one is it.Mrs. Mayville
"Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought ""Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man"". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least."
dont believe we received this book ...could you verify where it was sent and whenwas this a kindle fire book
"I really have to give this author credit, as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousin's killers, and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother. The book presents its facts on the case, leaving us to our own conclusions. What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read."
I thought the book was good to read. It gave me an idea of how the world really could be if it wanted to. I enjoyed reading it. I kept me in suspence.
"""A Time for Miracles"" is an underrated gem. Showing a bit of American history that is often neglected, and showing Kate Mulgrew as a determined woman who was strong willed, clever, not afraid of anyone, and was fond of coffee. No wonder she was cast as Katherine Janeway."
"Love this cd to bad it was the last Wings recored, all were gems the lp did not far good on release but it was still great."
Are they still alive? This CD stinks!!!! They are living off Media Baby Boomers Hype!!! When was the last time they had a hit 1970?
"I returned this product. The legs were too big and the waist too small. I looked like I was in a strait jacket. I have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it, other than the rubber smell I can't elimate, but this product sucks!"
"I was very please with how well made these rings are. They were very cheap compared to everything else out there, so I was prepared for shoddy quality, but that's not what came. They are really well finished."
"Although this extremely gifted author did an excellent job, a bit wordy for me. Just dont have the time to read this style of writing."
"This movie was nowhere near the original, so should you wish to watch it, don't expect to be in stitches the whole time. I honestly like it less and less each time I watch it, which to me is a mark of a bad movie. It does have it's moments, hence the 2 stars (it is after all Bill and Ted, it HAS to have moments!). My suggestion is rent/borrow it before purchasing it. If you love it--buy it. If not--don't."
I Love this. My kids have so much fun with these. They are strong and hold up to ruff play. They shoot water clear accross the pool.
"While reading this book I was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning. But as the book goes on, the main character continues to classify underwater creatures over and over and over. The only thing that kept me reading until the end was the mystery of Captain Nemo (which i have to say, was never really revealed, and a bit disapointing ending). So all together, and VERY detailed and interesting book, but too slow and boring overall."
"Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land, people, and dragons. Although, he needs to learn to be more original. I can see getting your inspiration from a book (The Lord of the Rings) but this is just taking it too far. Paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own!Eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive. Some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters. The story has an okay plot line and I am eager to see where it takes Eragon. But advice for Paolini on future books, use your imagination and do something original! It's easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new."
"This book shows you that Bob was a womanizer, but Bob was way worse than what this book says. Check out another book about Bob Hope called ""Thanks For The Memories"" by Brice Taylor. Yep, Bob and Michael Jackson had something in common, only Bob had underaged girls not boys."
"This a good movie in the same vain as most of Chuck Norris's films, plenty of action, a must have for your collection."
"To tell the truth I was a bit hesitant to purchase this book as loosing my ""joy"" was not something to which I was willing to admit.John Piper doesn't disappoint. His books are deep which is exactly what I needed as there are just too many superficial books on various Christian topics which tend to lack substance or depth or have any real effect in changing one's heart. John Piper tells it like it is and gets to the heart of the matter.I'm so glad I finally gave in and purchased this book. I have been blessed and I have been able to rediscovered the joy of the Lord that I had when I was first saved.If you can't handle the truth and are not wanting to actually put the time and struggle into what it takes to truly abide with God on a deeper level than this book is not for you. If you are a mature believer who needs a good kick in the pants than this is the book for you. Awesome book! If it is what you need then you will NOT be disappointed!"
I was definately not ready for the disappointment I suffered when I decided to buy this instead of another Tom Waits CD. I was very sorry to see that the early music by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies was just as god-awful as all the other alternative music that I hate.I like mittens!
"I love this book. I am almost done the series. It is an amazing book! There is a huge series coming after this book, three other series! I hope you like it! Rachael at age 11and1/2 :}"
"I'm afraid that I must agree with the comments of 'Tedious' below. Apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel (eastern religion meets western technology) their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half-way mark. This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors, but I must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy. The narative reads like a poor translation. Really bad style. A few funny moments... but overall, a very dissapointing book for me considering it's high falutin' reputation. I'll stick with Huxley, if and when I seek enlightenment."
I was able to easily search for a wireless network and set up my Tivo to my wireless internet! Works flawlessly!
"I remember the original NBC tv series, as it started my love affair with gangster films. This movie has taken all of the ""guts"" from the mini series, leaving it complete flop in all regards. Joe Penny and the rest of the cast deserve better than this butchered mess. I WANT the original at just about any cost. Can someone help me find it. E-mail me at theasburygroup@yahoo.com Thanks."
"I got this video on loan from Netflix. As a railfan, I was extremely disappointed in this. The show was nothing like I had anticipated it being like. And the host is just plain annoying trying to emulate Emeril Lagasse"
I love the Bradley smoker and these little bisquettes it uses. It is so easy to use. We've used the mesquite and pork and chicken. It's all turned out great.
I love the book...couldn't be more pleased with everything! I know I'll treasure this book for the rest of my life and will share it with my friends and family...because it will live on the coffee table in my sunroom for everyone to see!
"The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!"
"(The following comments pertain to the Sixth printing: June 2009 copy of the book)As noted by other reviewers, this version is riddled with numerous (and, in some cases, serious) errors that severely affect the overall worth of the book. In particular, Lesson 19 ""Positioning Two Columns with a Header and a Footer"" is the victim of an almost complete lack of editing/proofreading. I challenge anyone to follow the directions in this section and come out on the other side with anything that looks like the example in the lesson. The first few chapters are serviceable; the rest is hit or miss from what I experienced. Too bad."
"Once we finally rec'd the correct item ( orig order not from this company, so no reflection on them).....my husband loves it. He uses it for cold therapy only: his preference, not that it does not work well for that. So I can only tell you for cold therapy it rocks. I did not think it was cold enough for my lower back, but it is not sculpted for that. He loves its flexibility and states it is cold enough. He uses it for chronic neck pain. Just wraps it on his neck and goes to bed: it has a Velcro strap to keep it in place. Almost like having a neck pillow on, but not as bulky. FABU product!!!"
This album is awesome. I love the song Dive. This song kinda reminds me one of the songs that I used to sing in my church youth group. He always sings how a true christian (or should I say disciple) should feel. Especially in the song The Change. I saw him in concert in California. I was sixteen years old. The feeling that I had while I was at that concert was the best. I own all his albums. He never disapoints me. He is the main reason I listen to Christain music.
"Mysterious jazz that rolls into the imaginary worlds of a Native American dance, a smokey Nashville nightclub, a cruise with the whales...hints of Paul Consort with a crisp and haunting classical foundation, a journey through the 20th Century...and back again into the lonely Montana night where Ron strolls with star gazing abandon."
"The reader of this story was hard to follow because there was no difference in the voice of each charater. I found this hard to listen to and understand, sorry!"
Co worker need this movie I just ordered it for her. She has not offered any complaints of the product.
Why do Yankees always put Oasis down eh? They are the Greatest band ever. I live in the same City as they did and I'm listening to their music 24/7 People just get jealous of their success. If anyone agrees or disagrees e-mail me instantly!!!!
"This is noisy CD player it makes a whiring sound when CD's are played. Terrible fast forward and backwards, goes to slow. Awkward to use. Worst CD player I have ever owned. Don't buy it, you'll be sorry."
"This translation allows you to read the stories, which often are in poetry, with pleasure. I found the stories to be earthy, funny, but sometimes sad."
i just picked up the dvd of the first 5 episodes and must say that the vhs version {by jupiter} was much smoother and cleaner than this {dvd} version. however this is better than nothing as stated by others and my wife who has been a fan for nigh on 25 years now. so if you must have your starblazers as my wife does then definitely pick this up.AND SEND IN YOUR CARDS.
"DESPITE READING THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, I BOUGHT IT ANYWAY. THE WEIGHT PART WAS OK, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AEROBICS PART OF THE TAPE. DANCE STEPS TOO HARD TO FOLLOW, CAMERA ANGLES BAD. BORING...TO MUCH YELLING IN BACKGROUND."
"If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That's it!"
"We hate this thing. Hate. Hate. Hate.Even though it is supposed to hold three bikes, we can't even get two bikes on it, they are so squished together.Every time we try to use it, we just get covered in grease, angry, and abandon all hope of ever riding bikes somewhere that is not at home.Foaming raging hatred."
"These three discs are a perfect place to begin your Stereolab collection as it covers a wide cross section of ""the stereolab sound"".And the music...??? just look up the individual disc reviews on Amazon.It's all there....Enjoy"
"If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it, so its rare I ever complaint about it. Good series having played the games you will enjoy it more. Art style is diffrent its a good different nice change . For the price I paid 13 bucks its worth it"
"This was a great and is very magical. A young boy's nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him, you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure!!!"
"Quite often, bringing a classic story like ""Moby Dick"" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn't make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck's rendition instead. You'll be glad you did."
"With all of the mediocre crap such as ""Titanic"" and ""Ever After"" polluting the theaters and sending audiences into a frenzy, it's good to watch this classic and discover what actual monumental film-making is all about. God bless Kubrick for creating this ultraviolent masterpiece."
"Was hoping other reviews were off, but unfortunately they were right. Not even close to a recommended movie. Or as would be said by submariners, a true ""Five finger gagger""."
"I wouldn't recommend this book...I believe that Roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot going....I didn't enjoy reading Goodbye, Columbus, but I did enjoy reading the short stories where it is not about sex but rather about religion. thank you for the short stories...."
"My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy, so you wouldn't think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it."
"Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I'm so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land (""Welcome to Mongolia!"" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book."
"This book is ultra-rare, so if you can get a copy, keep it. I stole mine from the public library. The book visits some of the old Spacer worlds from the Robot novels, and it is interesting to see how time has treated them. This book also provides incite into the WHOLE Foundation series! THIS IS A MUST!!!!!"
"I liked Charles Dickens, The Christmas Carol, because it had lots of class. Dickens wrote about something and now you read it to your grandchildren on Christmas Eve. It's something that the whole family will enjoy. I know my family does."
"I remember when I thought this film was controversial lol that is until I saw ""Bully"" Anyway this movie is about a boy who is obsessed with (...) girls and well all the kids lives are pretty much full of drugs and sex. Good ending, what goes around comes around."
"I purchased and read this book because it was recommended by an author that has helped me develop in the screenwriting craft. But I didn't find it particularly helpful or practical. However, you might draw some inspiration from it."
"This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships, ranging from a Roman galley to a ""Nimitz""-class aircraft carrier. Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a ""great"" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book."
"I believe Shirley Horn and this CD are an undiscovered treasure. Well into her seventies and not recently in the best of health, Ms. Horn is a national treasure for jazz lovers. While she barely sings above a whisper, her emotion,timing and phrasing are on par with Sinatra--heady company indeed. This album showcases her vocal and piano skills in a golden light.Combined with the lush overlay of Johnny Mandel's beautiful string arrangements, this is a truly glorious cd that stays with you. Rarely have I seen a CD described on Amazon in such universally passionate and glorious terms."
"This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I ""attempted"" to read by the author, since I couldn't waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade."
"John Bunyan's, ""Pilgrim's Progress""has to be one of the most captivating books ever written. This book should be ""required reading"" in today's school system. From the verybeginning Mr.Bunyan spins the tale of a journey that is most fantastic! Thur perils unbeliveable he somehow overcomes tremendous odds ofcompleting it. But yet he does andthe rewards are magnificent. A MUSTFOR ANYONE BORN AGAIN!!!!!"
"I'm not a huge fan of Medieval literature, and perhaps this book is to blame. I think I've been spoiled by the Norton and Bevington anthologies I've used in other classes, because this was truly a let-down. If you're a prof looking for a good book to use for class, have your students spend the extra twenty-spot and get a Norton."
"When I was a little kid. I would try to watch these movies but they really freaked me out. Now that im 15 I had to give this one a try. Freddy's Dead was on television and once I saw one part with Freddy and Carlos(Carlo's ear) it freaked me out, but now I watched the whole movie of this and I have to buy the 8 disc box collection. I just special ordered it. This movie was really good. I can't wait to see all the other movies even that one part in Nightmare 6 with Carlos. Maybe this time I don't think it would be as bad, but I think everyone should give this movie a try. Wes Craven is very creative. I've seen his other work like Wishmaster 1-4 and he's done pretty good job. Check this one out!"
"Don't buy it. If Meth's new album isn't at least ten times better than this, then rap is officially dead, and the only thing that can resurrect it is a Bone Thugs reunion."
The volume is low and even with my Tv turned all the way up I can barely hear it : (
"MIXED explores the mixed-race experience and successfully dismantles so many common misconceptions about people of mixed-race or cross-cultural heritage. It's a gem that ought to be featured in high school literature courses not only for its collection of outstanding stories, but for the insights its contributors shed on the realities and paradoxes of the contemporary multiracial experience."
"Not much to say. Good story, Christopher Walken is awesome, great ending, not too much gore.Four more words are required..."
i ordered this movie off of amazon 2 months ago because my uncle in lebanon wanted it so i ordered it a month and a half in advance and i still have not gotten it this is horrible.
"I was not sure if I wanted a rocker or a fixed recliner for my outdoor porch. I came across this glider by accident and at first dismissed it. I remember as a kid seeing gliders made of metal with springs that groaned and made up of fused together rust. After reading other reviews and taking a chance, I bought it. It went together easily enough except for one locking bolt that did not line up. I had read another reviewers suggestion that I keep a drill handy, and with that and a little persuasion, it came together fine. Even though the wood was treated at the factory, I live in Florida where everything gets old before it's time,so I gave it a treatment with teak oil. It looks great, feels solid and is very comfortable. Great buy for the price."
i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
"This is an authentic masterpiece by the author of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, which tells a story of pirates in search of a treasure hidden in an island. Dr Jekyll is very different, a strange, puzzling, mysterious, symbolic story. The characters in Treasure Island are unforgettable, Jim Hawkins, Dr Livesey, captain Smollet, John Silver, the man without a leg who disappears in Latin America and the pirate Flint, a character who is always present, but only through the dialogues. This is a classic, but a cult novel as well."
It is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one. I saved a lot of money and didn'y worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
"I have been patiently waiting for some new Stones and what do I finally get, this group of songs some south Philly garage band could have written. What a disgrace for the Stones to put out this Lousy album. I am deeply disturbed buy the fact that people are giving this rave reviews just because it's a Stones album. Be ashamed, Be very ashamed of yourselves for telling people this CD is worth their hard earned cash!"
"This book was wonderful. I am a SAHM. I thought that Meredith did an excellent job on the book. I loved all the relationships and the e-mails going back and forth. What a refreshing format. This wasn't just a fun book though, it was deep and caused me to think deeper about my life and my relationships with my husband, kids, and other moms. I read this book in about a day. It was too good to put down.shannon"
This player freezes constantly. It's possible not everyone has this issue. Also the menus can be a bit sluggish. Don't buy without a good return policy.
"Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English? It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon, and a second disappointment. Perhaps I should not shop online. Regardless, it is a classic and, I suspect, not read by nearly as many who would enjoy it."
"Drew Barrymore has been having a hard time making good movies after making the the movie ""Ever After"" which i thought was a OKAY movie,which i gave **.but home fries was a horrible movie with a messed up script and plot.plus i thought it was too dark to be a comedy.*"
"For once, a film coming from a north european country that is neither unhealthy nor perverse.Suzanne Bier is a wonderful director as she proved in two of my favorite films ""Things we lost in the fire"" and ""Brothers""."
"One of the most beautifully filmed movies in recent years. The beauty of the images is about all there is to recommend here. The manipulative music is far too loud and sappy. Ethan Hawke is a robot. Scott Hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any DVD. Far too long, the only thing keeping your finger from the fast forward button are the images themselves."
As soon as I started reading this book I was hooked. Erin Hunter did a fabulous job capturing the readers intrest and keeping them interested. Even my brother (who hates cats) was compelled to read this novel.
"This book is about a social worker , who after years of helping others, must save herself from the grip of manic depression. Her struggle to get her life back together after a manic episode will touch your heart. The author shows a great deal of insight in sharing the many ways mental illness has touched her life and the lives of her family members. Overall the book is emotionally powerful, informative and well written."
"I recommend this book to any person on the face of the earth! This book is great for cat lovers,dog lovers,horse lovers,any kind of lover! After reading this I bought the rest of the series,and I know you'll love it too!! I SAY IT SHOULD BE AWARDED THE NEWBERY HONOR AWARD!!! Read this book to find how Rusty, a kittypet (a house cat) finds his destiny to become a great warrior!A #1 Fan,Kierstyn (Forestfur)"
"I have, too, but this isn't it. The translation is very choppy, the singers are medicore at best, and the orchestrations are too overwhelming. ""Love Changes Everything"" is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to it.Oddly, the best song is the French ""Chanson d'Enfance.""I was very surprised, as the Japanese usually put out extramely good cast CDS. Their CATS and Phantom and the Tokoyo Evita are all great. But unless you are a total ALW or AOL fanatic, save your money."
"Fantastic - it arrived yesterday, 4000 miles to England in under 5 days from ordering - well done Amazon! When I opened it I thought ""here at last is the bible I've been looking for for years""!"
"Admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior. Such ""intellectuals"" are painfully desperate and afraid of reality; for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip."
"I picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world (maybe something like Harry Potter!) but this book failed to deliver on that front. The magic was underhanded and unorganized. However, with that said, this was still a good read. Examining the dynamics between two generations of sisters was interesting, and the writing moved along comfortably. Overall, it's worth reading, but don't expect to be mesmerized!"
"I love horror movies!!! But this is really a horrible movie, the gore looks fake and a lot of it appears to be cg although some real props were used. The actresses were very bad at acting, and not in that cool b-horror movie way either, they suck. I know tons of gore fans like myself may like this movie but its trash,THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT IS ONLY 90 MINUTES LONG!!!!!!Guess I will start having to go back to the Asian import shop for good horror."
"Arrived on time in New,Unwrapped Condition. Amazon Connects with Topnotch Retailers that provideGreat Customer Service."
Fantasia always has a great product and once again they deliver. These pencils are superb and sturdy. Great for the half hazard artist whose product ends up all around them. These pencils crashed to the floor often and were not affected (Note: I do not recommend dropping ANY colored pencil)
Like visiting with old friends and enjoying a lovely chat. I've read this multiple times and always find the adventure great.
"We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"", that's what we're doing now."
"The storyline was superb. Rupert was great. But Madonna...what were you thinking??? Her accent annoyed me throughout the whole movie. Is she American??? Is she English??? The cross between sounds Australian which is irritating. Apart from Madonna's terrible acting, this movie is held together pretty well."
"If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya. I love her and her music. Her voice, music and her very being are inexorably intertwined giving us a feeling of warmth and passion in our hearts that I can not find the words to describe. How can I describe exactly how lovingly she finds the beauty that is still in our world, a beauty that each of us carries inside like a piece of some great cosmic puzzle that only has to be realized. Perhaps long in coming but I love the wait and savor the moment and here is Amarantine. I truly love every track but there seems to be a special place for ""It's in the Rain"" for me. I have said what I have tried to put into words. I just love her music."
"A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up."
If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie. They have turned what may be the best book of the series into an amusement park ride - all flash and no substance. As the books evolve J K Rowling has targeted an older and more mature audience. This movie targets the mindless.
I am so sick of these things being released without CDMA/EVDO or some cell service. From Nokia of ALL COMPANIES!Get with the times and offer an internet device that doesn't require me to be in 50 feet of a damn router.
"I wanted to start my own business, but I knew nothing about entrepreneurship. After reading this book, I feel confident about my new business venture. It is impossible to explain how valuable a tool this book is."
"Most Panasonic cameras have a pretty good battery life. Unless you shoot a lot of pictures, or use the flash a lot. In that case, you will need another battery and this is a good choice."
"This book explores the life of Olivia Winfield (a.k.a the Grandmother in Flowers in the Attic) Olivia is a 24 year ""old maid"" who's life is changed when the rich, aloof Malcolm Foxworth impulsively asks her to marry him. But upon arrival to her new home she discovers that she is only there to give birth to an heir. THis is a well-written book which tells you how someone so nice can turn into someone so evil, but I took off a star for the glaring errors that pepper this book."
"All the children magically popping up, some bad makeup, and a few sad tries at being funny is what makes this movie deserve such a low rating. I think they could have come up with a better Joseph than D. O.. I have seen it 6 times in live theater, and every time the show was better than the movie."
"This is the second time I've read the Hobbit but the first time I have owned it. It is an absolutely beautiful copy....gilded pages, leather cover with embossing, and a handful of illustrations. Definitely worth purchasing!"
"Overall, it was great. I, being a hardcore Tolkien fan, judged the movie with an extremely critical eye. The songs were well done. And the animation was o.k. It really only has one plot conflict,that being that they totally left out Beorn. Oh, yeah , the elves could have been portrayed better. They look like blue ants that got tangled up in the machinery of a textile mill. Gollum was wonderful."
"I bought this expecting to get the classic xmas movies such as frosty the snowman and rudoff the rednose raindeer. I was VERY disappointed to find out neither were included. It has such movies as Frosty gets Married and Rudoffs 4th of July, all dumb movies made after the original just for money that aren't any good. It leads you to believe its a bunch of the classics but it is not. BEWARE, READ CAREFULLY WHAT YOU ARE GETTING!!!!"
Best book I've ever read!! Love it. Recommend lord of the rings as well. J. R. R. Tolkien really is an amazing author!
"What a waste of two hours! As a romantic comedy, it falls short on both romance and comdey. As a movie trying to give over a lesson, it is trite, overdone, and poorly performed. The writing is unimpressive, the story is dull and far fetched, and many details either make no sense or detract from the overall plot. What was the point? They seemed to have forgotten to find one."
"The ""search inside"" feature of this ad shows gorgeous, color photographs of the birds; HOWEVER, the actual book's photos are in black and white! Admittingly, the photos here are more accurate than Dover's older version's drawings, but you will still need to refer to another source for color photos/drawings. If you already own an older copy, don't bother with this one! If you are buying for the first time, you will appreciate the large, clear photos, but know that they are all in black and white.Spacing of the text is another problem I have with this publisher's version. The lines of text are too close together for easy reading. Dover's version is easier on the eyes."
I got the wart stick for my grand daughter (11 yrs old) she has a wart on her hand and foot! but i was afraid to give it to her or my daughter because it looks just like chap stick! and my Grand daughter has a lot of little friends.so the stick is at the dump.there for i don't know if it works or not.
"Yoo's arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the Founders intended when creating our great country. He is undoubtedly intelligent, given the prowess with which he manipulates the Constitution and legal precepts into seemingly supporting his own theory. Despite the packaging, however, the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed. He is, at his core, merely an opportunist who advocates theories for the sole purpose of furthering his own career, rather than because they actually have merit. In other words, he's just a hack at heart. This book isn't worth your time or money."
"This book of poetry covers some very heavy stuff. At the same time, the subject matters cover a lot of matters that I've wanted to read for a while.I suggest that you do not read his poetry silently. Say it all out loud! They're meant to be read loud and proud. Trust me, that's worth it."
"Not very happy with the clarity of this phone. Also, very uncomfortable the way it rests on my ear and it also feels like I am talking into an echo. Taking it back to Staples tomorrow. Overpriced. Unsure of what else to buy. Just glad to dispose of it."
"Actually I would like the option to give this tape a 0 star rating. I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying ""Damn you, damn you!"" The knight/hero character says ""Damn."" A troll type creature says something like ""What the Hell, am I supposed to look at."" and a magician takes God's name in vain after being accosted by a tree he brought to life, which is a buxom ""woman tree"" who makes a pass at the magician. Shocking. If my nephews went up to their parents and used these expressions from the movie, they would be reprimanded by their parents who do not talk like that. I now know that I need to preview every video I buy for my nephews before giving them a present. Shame on Rankin Bass"
I have used this brand previously at work and have had good luck with them. The coating holds up to daily use and abuse.
"Well, if you are looking for a synopsis of the series, look at disk 1.This is probably one of my faovrite animes, and it's about time they brought it to the USA.Well now the important notes. This series DVDs as with most anime series DVDs are being released every other month. The doll that comes with the set has her feminine features far to over accentuated. I think mile long legs are great, but 2-3 mile long legs. Just get the regular DVD and save yourself a 10 spot."
This movie is SOOO funny!!! It's about these 2 party dudes trying to find their car in order to get their girlfriend's anniversery gifts in order to recieve 'special treats.' But along the way things don't go as planed. It's a comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Sean Scott. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!
"I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound, elegance, quality, essence, delicate sadness and youth. It is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post XX century pop music.I do recomended.(...)"
"Like so many others I wasn't going to comment on either of these books but some of the recent reviews pleading with people to read it makes me sick. Begging people to read this? DO read the reviews however AND DO read them with a grain of salt the good obviously are there to promot the book,but many of the not so good reviews are there to promote it too. Don't fall for this and waste money lining this author's pockets. I rate this as NEGATIVE -5 star! Don't buy this book! You are better off without it."
"I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now."
"I teach strategic management in the MBA program and do not recommend that this book be used. The cases are very dated and industry restructuring, as well as poor coverage of new technologies (such as the Internet), make this book tedious reading. Miller also fails to include several theories and frameworks (such as Porter's industry analysis) which gives spotty coverage to some areas. The international dimension is also very poor -- the assumption is that international environments are similar to domestic environments and a pursuit of profits (Miller's definition of success) is all that is needed in both for companies. Simplistic!"
"If you had a rating of -100 it would be rated below that. The case is solid but has no on & off switch. The soft ware program is rip rip rip off. no customer service. Still have not heard back from them.I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this product. It was awast of time, money & efor. do not,do not buy this product."
"If you purchase Millennium products by Farberware do not count on getting any satisfaction if you need to use the warranty. I sent in three pieces 5 months ago for what I was told was a 6-8 week process -- I'm still waiting, and every time I call I get a different line -- they are either incompetent or lying, or both. Decent products, unacceptable customer service -- buyer beware!"
"Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print, I realized I'd just read an earth shattering book on Wicca and Witchcraft. Taken in hand, with all the books with bad history, this book fixes them all. Just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its place.It is unapologetically Modernistic, with the sources to back it up.EXCELLENT, really, EXCELLENT."
"...I finally saw this film again and it wasn't too bad, though typical of the time it came out, as far as sound, photography, SPFX and acting, though the four leads were great: Randy Quaid, the beautiful Kate Capshaw (this was only her second film), Max Von Sydow and of course Christopher Plummer. It arrived from Amazon just days before Eddie Albert died but I didn't get around to watching it till a few days after that, so it was kinda bittersweet to watch. I could barely recall anything of it since I'd seen it only once at its initial theatrical release so this was a nice reminder. I recommend this to anyone looking for 99 minutes to kill if they've nothing else to do.Unintentional funny moment: When the paramedics try reviving a dead Mrs. Matusik the actress moves a split second before the paddles touch her."
The Precious Moments Stories are great.We like to keep them in our home to share with childrenthat come to visit ~ we enjoy watching them over and over again as well.
"this book had good morals but it was so confusing, that to even understand one of the main points in the book i needed cliffs notes. some of it was exciting inside the chapter but i cant remember one cliffhanger chapter ending. trust me, if you are a teen, take it from another, unless FORCED to read this for school (like i was) dont read this book. it isnt worth your effort to read such a terrible book. whoever called it a classic is crazy"
The creepiest book I've ever read! It's a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again lol
"The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963. The Amazon's Search-Inside(TM) refer to another update version of the book (9 ed.). The book's style and content is very old, the charts are hand-made and frankly speaking now it's possible to do much better and the calculation of indicators now can be exact. If you are interested to the prehistory of technical analysis a would suggest ""Welles Wilder - New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems"". Modern and better books are those of Achelis and Colby."
"So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?"
"The movie was well done and dramatic. The acting was good, although one could tell it was sectarian.My one main criticism is that the story did not portray the decisive factor in Luther's conversion - Justification by faith alone - sufficiently. This was the lynchpin and pivotal doctrine that separated Luther from the Catholic church and the papacy."
"This recording takes the dynamics to the point where some passages are barely audible and you have to strain to hear them and then as you're straining and your ears are completely open and unprotected you get hit with the frying pan. It's like being abused with music. An anxiety inducing recording. Tried listening to it numerous times, now I'm either donating it to the library or perhaps simply throwing it as far away from my person as I can without damaging my rotator cuff."
"While the finished product--a working phone with see-through cover and flashing lights--is great, this toy is definitely not easy to assemble. It took a bright 9-year-old, her 40-year-old aunt, and the child's grandfather (well-versed in electronics) two hours or more to finally get all the pieces in place! The parts seem to be well made and the phone really *does* work, but the directions are very difficult to understand and there was no explanation whatsoever of how a phone works. In short, what was supposed to be a fun ""learning experience"" turned out to be an exercise in frustration. This kit is probably best suited for teenagers or adults who already have some background in electronics."
"The horse seems sturdy but to the person who said it took 15 minutes to assemble they must be superman. My husband and I just finished putting it together for Christmas and it took us at least an hour. The instructions are horrible and the springs are a nightmare to hook together. We never did get the ""safety"" hook in. ADVICE: put on the spring covers BEFORE hooking the safety straps to the wooden pegs. The instructions say the other way around but that is impossible.It does seems sturdy though and I like the sounds. I'm sure our 2 yr old will love it in the morning."
"I have read the other reviews of this book, and while I appreciate everyone's opinions I must say that this book helped me immensely! I am new to the gluten free life. I have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues. I had NO prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears. I haven't read Against the Grain, so I cannot compare the two. Jax made me laugh often, even through my tears. I recommend it for those just starting out."
I am not much of a reader but I must say I really liked it had little dragged out spots very adventures
"Well, yeah, I saw ""What the *bleep* Do We Know"" and got very excited and bought all of these books. While I appreciate Mr Emoto's subtley and humility in presenting his work, it winds up being just as hard to stomach that much of it is thinly veiled hoopla with little or no solid science behind it. He fails to explain how many photos he took of each kind of water he photographed for instance-- there are just too many gaping holes. But hey, what the bleep do I know? When it comes down too it, I think this sort of physics, philospohy/spiritual theory of everything-- kind of stuff is just as undocumentable and faith based as any other sort of religious ideology. More than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking."
"Since the book is one of the more expensive Luna line books, I just wanted to throw my two cents in to hopefully save you some of YOUR hard earned money since I already wasted mine on this book.What started out as quirky and light, quickly turned terribly cheesy, goofy,implausible and over the top cliche' with an almost nonexistent storyline about 80 pages in. It reads like teen fiction-and not in a good way. And yet again in the steadily disappointing Luna line-almost zero romance. Take my advice and skip this sad attempt."
It was grat at some parts and boring at others. The end made up for alot of the book.
"This has to be one of the most amazing cd's ever! Britney Spears only wishes she could make music like this. Great pop beats with meaningful lyrics align all the songs here.Coming from someone who loves Madonna, Stevie Nicks, Michael Jackson. This is one of my favorite cd's of all time. I absolutley love each song to pieces.The album is very dark pop/electro, and it's enhoyable from start to finishMy favorite songs are How soon is Now, Stars, 30 minutes, and of course the classic Not Gonna Get Us, and All the Things she Said.BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!You have to listen to it! it's phenomenal!!"
"after re reading how fire is made ,what seemed like a 1000 times I decided this was the most boring book ive read in a long time."
"This book is a sure snooze-fest. Luckily for me I did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. We read selected chapters of the book.They writing was horrible. Many parts were unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over. I can't stand this style of writing. Barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. Instead, he comes off as boring and pretentious.Skip this book... try something else."
"Truly a pathetic film.The only few minutes of the film that was interesting was the very beginning after this it raced downhill.The Demons and characters were all unbelievable except for the female lead. I can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind, deaf and dumb. I have never been a fan of Keanu Reeves but some of his films have been exciting. He brought nothing to this nothing. It is hard to tell whether the fault is the script the director or the actor. In short the film was a total waste of time. More than that it was a total theft of time."
"After reading the Ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face, this was a wonderful and refreshing perspective. Teenage girls who are self-confidant, not worried about pleasing others with who they are, eloquent, etc. How encouraging! I'm looking forward to reaping some of these benefits of homeschooling..."
"After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human."
"Received this as a Christmas gift from a dear friend, and I just love it. Keeps me in the moment and helps me remember all the wonderful things to be grateful for each day."
All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.
I can't believe how awful this movie was and I love zombie movies. It was like watching a SyFy movie of the week. Waste of $$$$. Sucked.
"Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it."
"For the Love of Children, is filled with wonderful stories and quotes that will let any parent at any phase of parenting know that they are not alone.It is delightful to hear other people give voice to my parenting challenges, such as Robert Frost's statement about a father and mother toward son and daughter. One of the best quotes, ""If you don't want your children to hear what you're saying, . . . . pg 27"
"Joseph lovers; you will be disappointed with this film. Family viewing it is not. Potiphar's wife and her servants are definitely R rated, and you may be embarrassed to watch this with your children. The narrator is breathy and sexy, which may work in some venues, but not when she is narrating a Bible story to a grade school assembly. Rent it and get it over with, but you'll probably grate at the slow musical pace."
"this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance, child abuse, the effects of peer pressure, etc. it reflects the basic christain view that man is vile.itis obvious that golding never considers that by the time any of these boys has spent time in their families and then in the prep school, any natural impulse has been thoroughly ground out bysocial standards. these boys are as affected by all they psychological influences as adults, with fewer methods to deal with them.of course they revert to so-called savagery--it's what they experienced at their school. of course there are no intelligent responses, we aren't trained to use intelligent response.the book is a polemic of the conservative christian--man is vile and must be controlled or he will become a savage.nurture has no place.i find it a completely annoying book, presenting an unrealistic result."
I have had this concert on VHS for almost 20 years and have been waiting for the DVD. I just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync. The sound and picture are about a second off from each other. Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD.
"I bought this book as a gift to impress the receiver. To my shock, the receiver told me the book was very nice indeed but it contained only the first half of the book. I did not see anywhere where we are told about this being only half of the book unless you include the Library Journal description."
"Ordered on same day as Tivo but came 8 - 10 days later. Caused a delay in hooking up. It would helpful to ensure shipping at the same time, especially when one unit is dependant on the other. Unit dropped off line after the first installation and had to be rebooted. Seems to be OK now.This is my first Tivo and adapter so I have nothing to compare this product with."
"Worked perfectly from the start. Simple. Clean. No hassle. Pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow, and avoid refilling a cartridge which has been empty for some time (it has dried up and may not refill properly). Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the calibration marks on the ink tank serve as an excellent guide to monitor how much ink has gone into the cartridge.Construction quality is very precise... much better than I would have expected for a product of this nature. This product will save HUGE dollars over feeding HP their profit gouging prices for OEM. Hooray!"
"I can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me, reading them in a bookstore in Albuquerque. Inventive, humane, human, magical."
I have all the Batman Series of movies and am a comic book fan from way back. I wanted the new take on the character. The movie doesn't disappoint. It goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character. The cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film. This is a more serious Batman than some of the other incarntions. The action is fast and cast is great. I will enjoy this movie over and over.
"Boring and tedious! Repetitious story line both from earlier books and from within this story -- how many times do you have to tell Ms Auel, I'm not stupid, you know. Hard-to-remember names, and an error-ridden Kindle transcription add to this reader's frustration. I'm new to Kindle and wonder if all Kindle books are subject to transcription errors or did someone forget to edit this one? Tell you what, Amazon, let me be an advance reader, give me the titles for free and I'll edit for you."
This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along. The DVD has some great features and great picture quality. The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time is not an issue. This is well worth the money to buy.
"As the other reviews noted, there are problems with installing this card, even though I got it working successfully in the end. Although it isn't my top pick for a graphics card, I have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my VCR and print my digital videos to VHS (yes, this is possible, although it is a bit tricky to setup.)I withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup. If the user manual would have been more comprehensive, and if the ATI website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card, the whole nasty ordeal of card setup (that almost all night) might have been spared."
"Someone once said ""there are three kinds of liars: liars, damn liars, and statisticians.""I read this book in high school, and it shaped my judgement of the news media, business, and advertising ever since. Never trust the numbers without knowing their basis, and remember: a statistician is the type of guy who would put his head in an oven, and his feet in a bucket of ice, and say that, on average, he felt fine."
"A wonderful and creative album. Great listening from start to finish. Belongs in every jazz library along with Blue Train, Giant Steps, and Kind Of Blue."
"Okay, everyone who's given this movie a good review and critiqued the rest of us for comparing it to the movie, is not too bright.What you fail to realize, is that the movie doesn't form a coherent plot, unless you've read the fourth book. So, the book fails on two fronts. As a movie, it isn't coherent enough to be considered good. Too much time is spent on things that aren't crucial, while crucial events are extremely undercovered (see Chapters 1-12).As a movie replicating a book, it miserably fails. All can agree.1 Star. Next time, pick a side, and stick to it."
"How did this piece of junk ever get made? Granted, I'm not a teenager, but I hope that even teenagers have brains enough to recognize a dog when they see one! The only reason I viewed this film is because of the previews, they were pretty comical. But three or four scenes don't make a movie. What's wrong with screen writers these days? Whoever wrote this must have been related to some one in upper management, otherwise it would have never been produced. The writer should have smoked the script, it would have saved us all some money."
"No footnotes or references, just your basic Bible. It's nice and small but still readable. Fits right in my purse. The only complaint I have is that I left it in my Jeep during the summer and the cover curled up pretty bad but not bad for the price."
"I'm not the most analytical reviewer out there for some of you who want a ""well-reasoned"", ""logically-based"", ""original"", ""thought-provoking"" review. I simply like what I hear or I don't. But I love music and certain bands I have loved for 40 years. The Rolling Stones is one of them. I picked up the CD simply because it was the Rolling Stones. I listened to it and from the first it sounded just EXCELLENT. They kept to the formula and then spiked it! I'm not going to compare it to past albums, or group line-ups or anything. I cannot tell you if it is better or worse than other albums. This one just stands on it's own! If you do love the Rolling Stones, you will be floored! Let me just tell you that in their golden years, the Stones still had the ""stones"" to pull it off again. You pick this CD up for the heck of it, and you walk away 100% satisfied that you got your money's worth, and unlike Mick, YOU GET SATISFACTION! What a superb rocker!"
"I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005. The rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why I purchased this. However, the wall of the tubing is made from incredibly thin brass and will bend if you hang a wet towel on it. The chrome plating is also of poor quality. For $100, you would think this would be top quality. Don't waste your money on this item."
"Great reading, year after year his works endure. Wish I had had the opportunity to meet him in person, no I'll haveto wait until the afterlife. Hope we both end up in the same place."
"Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys, attempting to foil the sinster plots of the CIA. However, Semenov lacks the semantics of say, a Tom Clancy. The plot is razor thin, the anti-semitism is revolting, and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable.While the book is certainly dated, (Cold War intrigue in Africa is so passe), it is an entertaining read if only to see how the USSR understood detente and cold war politics. Other than that, the book is tripe - not recommended."
"This card has to be the bast purchase I've ever made! The grapghics are great, it's DirectX supported (a biggie) and is far superior to most cards of the same price. The reviewer who says it doesn't work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card. If he bought the AGP card, maybe he should try the PCI. Anyway, this is a great video card from a great company for a great price. BUY IT!"
"One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay, Fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to McKellen's anguished and self-defeated character. Make a point to get this one. Best screenplays consist of strong dialogue, pacing, and narrative. The Oscars are usually accurrate about that."
"While my sister was extremely excited about the glasses I got her has a gift, one arrived broken. When I called customer service to replace the broken glass I was notified that Amazon would not replace the damaged item. I could get a full refund, but they would not send a replacement. I was appalled. What business refuses to replace damaged items? You can guarantee I won't be buying anything being shipped through Amazon anymore. I will buy directly from the seller."
"This book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible. Reverend Teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities. The book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion, Jesus, and God and take a look at it in a most unique way. I went into the book on the defensive as a fundamentalist Christian and found myself following the argument of Reverend Teel and even, at moments, agreeing with him. While I certainly don't agree with all of the points he brings out, he does bring up some really good questions and gives some really provocative and thought provoking answers. He asks the reader only to keep an open mind and in the end I was moved by the book, I'm recommending it to all of my friends."
"I must have seen some kind of ""director's cut"" of Gladiator; that's the only way that I can explain the fact that everyone seems to like, or at least to tolerate, this complete waste of film stock.I've rarely seen a movie with a real budget that was more poorly written. Every line made me wince. And the historical inaccuracies are so widespread that it's really not possible to talk in any meaningful sense about this movie being a tale of ancient Rome.You'll probably like it, though -- everyone else seems to."
"God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book, I'll admit it is a very true commentary on society. The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it! The Simpsons parody of it is also a good thing to watch. At least in a cartoon it is entertaining, with just as much commentary on society as the original."
"Queen loved to experiment. Every time they released a new song, I would hear it and say (in delight), ""Is that Queen?"" However, this album abandoned all that was Rock and Roll and gave into the pop craze of disco that can only be classified as the dark ages in pop music. The only bright spot from this album was ""Under Pressure."" Thankfully, they pulled out of it to cement themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time."
"They make it sould like these are active noise canceling headphones. They are also priced like they are. However, they are just over-prices bud headphones."
I was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not. I even purchased two sets. The light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs.When it is on the light setting it isn't enough light to even guide you along a path. I am very disappointed in it.We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these.
"Mariah and Whitney are (together with Celine Dion and Aretha Franklin) the greatest singers alive! They really show their voices power in this song, and they made a wonderful job together! Well done, girls! Well done!"
"Bill & Ted are killed by ""robot us-es"". They were sent from the future to prevent the birth of ""Wyld Stalions"" Bill & Ted must now challenge death & escape the afterlife to set things right. Side splitting fun! Recommended!"
I just updated to the newest firmware (1.5 4/12/2007) and the disc is now PLAYABLE in my XA2. Big relieve for all I hope. Review of the source to follow.
"I've given away at least a dozen copies. I don't want to spoil anyone's delight in reading, but I will say that the content remains controversial. Debby Goldstein"
My son is 2 1/2 and spends hours a day playing with his table. Wonderful purchase! Only negatives is that one leg was cracked during shipping and the other is my little boy is too busy playing for me now!
"I can't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd. This is a great movie, don't get me wrong. It's Kurasawa, after all. My one star is for the people at Mei Ah who put out this dvd. Whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak English well enough to graduate from a level one ESL class. The subtitles are truly terrible, sometimes bizarre, and I thought at times I was dreaming I was watching a Monty Python skit. Alas, I was not; this was for real. Such a shame."
"I was intrigued by the now cancelled TV show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so I could have some closure on the story. Unfortunately, the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show. The books ends about where the show picks up. Needless to say I am still in the dark about where the story goes and how it ends. Very frustrating. It was a decent book up to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending."
"My cable was out, and I missed my favorite shows. Thank goodness for Amazon where I could watch them and not worry about viruses or signing up for a monthly fee. Thanks!"
"I have to say for the first time in my life the movie is way better than the book, it is totally disjointed and full of unnecesary profanity. The author comes across as very immature and a total whiner. Don't bother buying it, the movie is much more enjoyable."
"Good price, excellent design and shipped well.Would've been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving."
these daipers are no good to use.. always leaks and gives diaper rash.. not worth the money.. Pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers.
"This book was a great find! It has more information than pictures which is okay, it is very descript in its information and easy to read. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to further their knowlegde in this art."
Have not been able to watch it as the picture and noise (not movie noise) is so bad. Sorry
"Dean -- Love the book -- especially the pictures of Gavin and me -- but you know that. To anyone else who reads this: Dean knows whereof he speaks: He's a good hiker and builds a good, environmentally sensitive campfire. Hope you don't mind my using this avenue to try to get your e-mail address."
"This book was pretty good. It took a while to fully get into the story and I did not think the plot or action moved along enough, but am interested to see what happend to the cahracters in book 2. You can tell it was written by a teenager as some of the vocabulary, plot development, and character assessment were rather rudimentary. I did like how there were some new types of chracters introduced into the fantasy world, such as the werecat, But overall, it was worth the read."
"I normally buy Pampers Cruisers, I will not buy these again. They seem really cheap, plastic like, I don't like the smell. Yuck, can't wait for the jumbo pack to be done!"
"I would review the movie just the DVD! First of all there are no making of, storyboard,production notes or any extra features ! The only extra feature you get with this DVD is the trailer! Oh, did I mention that the DVD has beautiful picture on it! Rent it first ,then buy at Disney outragous price that they want for this DVD! Just watch later on Disney will reissue it (and the others in their collection with all the extras this DVD lack! If you want those extra features stick with the studios Disney owns! They are Miramax,Dimension,Hollywood Pictures,Touchstones Pictures,ABC network,Anchor Bay and Walt Disney Pictures! I hope this info helps others looking for disney movies other than the animated movies!"
"This version of the play is MISSING Acts III and IV.Act IV, Scene ii contains some of the most famous lines of Shakespeare: ""Fear no more the heat of the sun ..."" So, if you need this play, are crunched for time, and need it to supplement a research paper on stream-of-consciousness and Mrs. Dalloway ... I would definitely GET ANOTHER VERSION!Thanks a lot for the complete rip off."
"I've tried many diapers over the years and I've found that Pampers are the best. They fit well, provide the right amount of ventilation so our babies don't get a rash and they hold a lot of liquid. My only complaint is the price. They are so darn expensive!"

"Although this book may contain over 30,000 foods, (not just 20,000 as the synopsis claims) it only contains sodium, calorie and fat statistics for them. I bought this book looking for the potassium values that the synopsis suggested it contains. It does not. My sole purpose for purchasing this book was falsely advertised in the synopsis and thus this book is absolutely useless to me. Thanks for nothing."
"This movie is hilarious!! I found it amazing because this film was truely a pionear of its genre(parody). This was before Lethal weapon and even before the movie ""Clue"" it is indeed one of the first of its kind.It follows the same basic premise as most other murder mystery movies but it turns all of the stereotypes on their head.For example-The butler is blind and this is but one many things that make this movie unique. You can tell the producer and director had a lot of fun making this one.The first time you watch it you can have a dozen different guesses for how the movie turns out but you will not be right. I love this movie!!"
"My husband got this as a hand me down and started reading it today. I glanced at the page he had open and am horrified at what I read. Page 8 in the grey box titled ""Age Differences"" and I quote ""For the first 6 months, infants do not feel love and affection. They are wholly dependent on their caretakers to have their needs met-that's all"". What old school garbage! As a mother of a 3 week old it's already obvious to me that my daughter feels love and affection."
my first panasonic 2563 works great...this 2583 won't hold a charge for more than 10 minutes talk time...and it's only two weeks old!!!!!!!!!!customer service offered to replace it with a refurbished model when all i'm looking for is a new battery...i paid top dollar so that i could trade it in two weeks later for a refurbished unit...........i'm very dissapointed with them...never another panasonic.
"This book has so many pearls of wisdom. It's very simply written, so do not expect this to be a typical NYT bestseller like the one you read last week. I believe this book was written in the '40s, and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time, it has a timeless and universal appeal. I haven't even finished it yet, but have already decided, enough with the library version, I want my own copy so that I can use the advice it offers later on in life. Don't miss this one, and make sure you tell your friends about it, so that they can come and thank you later, and you can say ""I told you so""."
"[...]When I was in grade school I could remember the corny holiday card making projects. Those with no originality, which were the majority of kids in school, sprinkled glitter and crappily and happily glued little bows on the card. Those few who rebelled and wanted to differ from the class herd, drew Santa on fire or added some far different materials on it. The point of the metaphor is,Yeah, you love/like Eragon, not so much because it is your genuine preference, but because you do not want to differ from the class herd. That and you probably lack a basic reading in significant literature. But hey, if this author can sell-out and sell his books out, more power to him. You have a right to your opinion. But that doesn't make this book read any less like hackneyed cardboard fantasy prose...it still does."
I haven't even taken this out of the box yet but I got it at target for $50! This item is definitely overpriced.
"Don't waste your money. Not worth the time to download much less the purchase price. When it does start, the display doesn't refresh properly and the screen fills up with garbage and you can't see what is happening on the screen."
"I highly recommend this item, and it's a great price with Amazon Prime.My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that it's like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast. It also folds up into a rather small rectangle, and it comes with a canvas bag for store."
"Our almost 3-year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart, our 15-month old perks up when ralph is on, and we parents hum the tunes and enjoy the smart lyrics - even though we hear this music daily ! The music is rich and doesn't go stale, and manages to bridge the generation gap."
"I find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music, as a vivd music listener and an open minded one at that, this music was the most horrid bit of sound I have ever heard. People need to stop and remember what real talent is, not this uncoordinated, bad singing group. Their music is as is they are making up the guitar riffs as they go, and I don't find it difficult to scream. So Glassjaw if your ever in need of a new screamer, I'm your man."
"A wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know. The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there."
"Nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but the manufacturer's original box had been opened before and rather clumsily taped back together, and the ""aluminum"" case is covered in small scratches and dents. I don't have the time to return the set for replacement since it was bought as a gift for an upcoming occasion. Disappointing."
Didn't see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an X-box you can play the Constantine video game.
"This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice."
"While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don't think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product."
As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented
I was a little dissapointed with this purchase because it claims to be hardcover but in actuality it is three ring punched and individual pages. It is complete and in very good condition though. I would still consider purchasing from this agent since the prices are very low.
i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig. may try later. the company contacted to advise of this mistake.
"I wanted to like this book. I've curled up with it a couple times now, thinking that I was just being difficult and should give it another chance. I absolutely love Laurie Colwin's writing, surely I should enjoy this. But I just didn't. I can't explain why sometimes cranky writing is warm and endearing and sometimes it isn't, but something is lacking in this book. And while it's true that she tracks down such things as bone marrow and squab for authenticity's sake, she misses another recipe's texture completely because she doesn't have a cooking thermometer. Surely every grocery store with even a handful of implements for sale offers a cooking thermometer (probably for less than the cost of a squab)?"
"We love this album. SO glad we did not read the negative reviews or we probably would not have bought it. We heard the television promo with some of the song highlights and immediately went to Amazon and pre-ordered it. We take it with us on car trips and love to sing along. It is a peppy and a fun companion for the car. We would have given it 5 stars if it had ""Leave Virginia Alone"" on it. That was one of his biggest hits and one we also enjoy. If you like the songs on the album, by all means by it and forget about what the negative reviews say about Rod. It is a good album and he doesn't deserve the criticism."
I was about 16 years old when this movie was in the movie theaters and being a fan of Brooke Shields I watched Endless Love and I actually liked it but unfortunately I let some people convince me that it wasn't a good movie to like but now that I'm older I find that I like this movie again and think it was good so I'm editing an older review that I wrote in which I gave it a low rating of two stars but I now would rate it 3 1/2 stars.
This was a refreshing book. I thought it was written with great insight. The ending was a change from the typical happy ending. The characters seemed real not fictional. I liked that your evil character Virgil had more than one personality trait. Thank-you for having a conference call on a Saturday morning; that was really gracious of you to do that. Thank-you for writing this wonderful book. I can't wait to read any other books you write!
"Was this book edited? I think the publisher should be ashamed. If you can slog through the grammatical errors, typos and generally poor writing, you might find this book interesting. However, given that it appears to have been unedited, and given that folks in-the-know have pointed out technical inaccuracies to me, I wouldn't take anything written in this book as the gospel truth. It did raise some interesting questions that I will research.I will think twice before buying a book from this publisher again."
"Five-star rating for the quality of the product, but they run small. I ordered a large and it was just too small for me. I wear 36"" pants comfortably, although I measure 38"" around my waist at its thickest point. My thigh is 25"" at its thickest point, and I measure 41"" around my butt."
"They sent an imitation; Holt from china instead of the advertised Halti, and it cut my dog's face! I tried contacting them, but no response."
"Carrot, Vimes, Colon, Nobbs are back. With also alot of new recruits:Angua, Detritus and Cuddy. What is the mysterious thing killing dwarfs, clowns and assasins? Is Vimes finally going to get married? Who knows?"
"Dont' bother with these rotors! They warped after barely 300 miles. I was assured by PowerStop that their products were NOT from China, yet after peeling off a label on the box, it was clearly marked, ""Made in China"". So either these are NOT really from PowerStop, or I was lied to."
The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
The main character was insufferable. Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably. She appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything. At least Spencer admits to feet of clay. The plot was implausible.
"We unpacked this small module, plugged it into the TiVo, followed the on-screen instructions, and we were set up within 15 minutes. We cancelled our landline telephone service, not considering that our TiVo subscription required dial-up access. We ordered this product right away, and it arrived within 3 days, and was simple to set up. So far, no problems!"
I would not buy this edition. The printing is terribly small. Its about half the size of normal print. And there is no introduction. Usually these types of works have some sort of preface which introduces the reader to the material.
Is this the current state of scholarship at the Academy today?? No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions?? Are we supposed to believe these pinheads just because they have PHD behind their name? The other side can list hundreds of primary sources in their works. I'm sure all the pc teachers and profs love this and it will probably be a staple at every modern college. Not worth a dime for a thinking person who really wants the truth.
"I love Louis L'Amour, especially his epic series: The Sacketts. The stories are believable, tautly written and accessible for just about anyone. Unfortunately, the same cannot not be said about this movie, which is based upon two of the stories: The Daybreakers and Sackett. With great anticipation I watched this movie. I wanted to enjoy it, but no matter how hard I tried I coundn't for one simple reason: The acting is atrocious! Tom Selleck is awful. Mercedes McCambridge is awful (really awful), and sadly, worst of all is Glenn Ford. The best acting comes from the veterans Ben Johnson and Sam Elliot, barely. What frustrates me is that these are talented actors! What kind of direction were they receiving from Robert Totten?? ""One take and next scene"" must have been his credo. Really disappointing.Don't waste your money. Read the books instead."
"Sowell is a true intellectual. He is not afraid to go where his mind takes him. In this work he takes on his common peeve: social engineering. For Sowell nothing is worse than utopian minded do-gooders armed with inadequate knowledge of the subjects they pontificate on. To be frank, I think Sowell's arguments are sometimes thin (much social engineering is done well and is necessary), but it is always good to read someone who will challenge convention, especially when that person is as bright as Sowell is."
"I knew nothing of Robert McDuffie until I heard him perform the Mendelssohn Concerto at Wolf Trap with the National Symphony. That performance led me to seek out this CD, and McDuffie's playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance. His tone may not be as big as Itzhak Perlman's, but it is nevertheless exquisite (the phrase ""spun silver,"" though cliched, is apt). This is true concerto playing, the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra (and, by extension, with the listener). I definitely will seek out more of McDuffie's discs, and I hope others will, too."
"I bought this for my buddy. He had looked at one, and he loves it now that he has it! Stylish and functional, what else could you want?"
"This is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog (surprising given the starry nature of the human cast), close to nonexistence suspense, and muddy sound recording compounded with hard to understand dialog (English accents and all that). Gielgud's performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional (when you can understand his delivery); as the heroine, Carroll's ""acting"" ranges from chatty to zombie; and Lorrie's delivery is over-the-top ham (and, quite frankly, an embarrassment) as he portrays the ""good-guy"" killer. All this is in marked contrast to the achievements of the fourth principal performer, Robert Young. Young provides an acting tour de force as the subject matter of the film. He makes the film his own!There are some gee-wiz (for the time, 1936) special in-camera/editing effects which were then fast becoming (and would continue to be) a Hitchcock trademark.Not one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but not one of his disasters either.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D"
Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one.
"I was a big fan of Auel, right until this book arrived. It's approximately 700 pages long and it took nearly 500 pages before it starts to get interesting. I skipped chunks of pages because they are pure repitition from earlier in the book. I'll probably buy the next one but only because of the first three and to see how it ends. Hopefully Auel won't let us down. If this book was half the length it would potentially have been great. I was disappointed."
"This book was excellent. The author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the 20th century: Babe Ruth. Overall, we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong 20's into the 30's.My only issue was that I didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death. I would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death. Plus I would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his death.Nevertheless, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan."
"I have read all Philip Yancey books & he gives an intellegent & amazing insight of the true religious life demonstrated in the Bible. This provides a person the detailed readings therein, its relationship to everyday life experiences .... all is in proper perspective. It's also an excellent tool for Bible Study. I have it in printed book form & also on my E-Reader.Don't leave home without it."
"A friend introduced me to this CD and it's quickly become a favourite. M.I.A.'s music so catchy and so fun to dance to, yet it's also lasting...I've been listening to it over and over. And I love the fact that she brings an ethnic vibe into her music."
"I bought this book because I found The Club Dumas to be excellent. I was deeply disappointed. Where The Club Dumas sparkled, The Seville Communion merely exists, and while The Club Dumas transcended its genre, The Seville Communion is deeply rooted in it. And that's a shame, because it means the mastery exhibited in The Club Dumas is a one shot deal rather than the arrival of a major literary talent"
I have read this book several times since I was a pre-teen. It's like visiting an old friend each time. I love it. One of my all time favorites.
Reasonably priced and shipped on schedule. Valves and membranes were new and in packaging as described. Pricing is very competitive and purchasing was easy.
"I gave this one star, because negative stars are not allowed. The previous review has to have been written by someone closely related to the book.I was a teen-ager during the '80s Ninja Craze and even then, this book would have been seen as a complete joke. I think I was expecting a Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon to turn up somewhere in the book, but was disappointed to not see one.Bottom-line - Stay away from this book. If you are really interested in something about ninja, look into Stephen K. Hayes."
I WAS LOOKING FOR INEXSPENSIVE HDMI CORDS FOR MY PS3 AND MY NEW HD TV.. WELL EVERYONE TOLD ME U HAVE TO GET MONSTER CABLES THERE LIKE 50$$$ BLAH BLAH BLAH...!!!! WELL I FOUND THESE AND THOUGHT HEY THERE CHEAP SO IF THEY DONT WORK OH WELL.. BOY I WAS WRONG THEY ARE GREAT.. THE TV IS AMAZING AND THE PS3 GAMES LOOK SOOO GOOD!!!.YOU DON'T NEED THOSE OVER PRICED MONSTER CABLES .THEY SHIPPED TO ME FAST.. I EVEN GOT THEM EARLIER THAN EXSPECTED.( I KNOW I WAS CHECKING MY MAIL BOX DAILY) .I WILL DEFINATLY BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!! THANKS GUYS!!!
"This book was romantic drivel. It made me think it was pulled directly from the pages of an early 1970s Harlequin. While wonderful at the time, this book will leave today's modern romance reader cold. Latter Day Saints, this is a book you can sink your teeth into."
"Wasn't sure what was wrong with my ice maker, so I bought this kit. Replaced just the main ice maker component (took less than 10 minutes), and the unit started right up. It has been making ice reliably. Great deal."
"Excellent voice, excellent lyrics, excellent music... This cd has is all. Every track on this cd shows Clay Aiken's pure and natural talent. This cd has not been out of my cd player since its release date, Oct 14, I listen to it everyday. Finally with all the gimmacks that other pop artists try to pass off as talent, there is a young man that has talent, a gift to us all, a truly beautiful voice. Clay fills the void of what is missing in today's music, A REAL SINGER, and he does it so well.Its a shame that I could only give it 5 stars because its so much better than that. Clay is a keeper with the talent to be around for a long time."
"WHAT A TOY!! Better than the Thomas table, this thing is solid! SO nice, it comes with all the people and vehicles and trees and fire departments, etc. I am overwhelmed. My 2 year old loves it and has not stopped playing with it! Thanks!!!!"
"I like one song on this cd. ""It's in the Rain"" is a beautiful song. The rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date.I have all of her other cds and I usually enjoy them, but this is the first one that I only like one song. Creatively, this one is missing something. She also looks silly on the cover.So far in 2005, the only artist to release a completely amazing cd is Madonna with ""Confessions on a Dance Floor."" Maybe Enya could call Madonna's producer. She needs a new sound. It's time to reinvent yourself, Enya!"
It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
"It is a great tale,perhaps historical, i`ll have to go o computer to decipher it!!!!Maximus the great!More words is tooo much folderal!11111"
"We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small, and didn't really hold enough water to keep her warm.I think it would work ok for an infant, although I think a blanket would work just as well.Recommendation:Buy********************HoldSell"
"While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading."
"I was a little confused by reading reviews but I decided on the goFit ball at 65cm and it worked out just right for my 5'8"" frame. There was no odor from the ball and was not difficult to blow up the ball with the pump provided.Did my abdomial exersizes with no proplem with my 215 lbs of body weight.I would recommend this item."
"The product once installed looks like its from 1990, and all it does is quiz you. It doesn't really explain anything and it's not very interactive. [...]"
"Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world. I think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page, and even when he does get it right, he often distorts the facts. Catholics should read this just to see how far anti-catholics will go!"
"When I first heard the cd I was a bit shocked. These musicians really have a unique way of playing these pieces. I am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique. The more I listen, I start to appreciate and understand the point in using the playing style that they do. I realize that this is very close to the way it ones sounded and that is very exciting I think. The lack of constant vibrato and the glissandos that are frequently used creates a completely new atmosphere which I think is very suitable for this music. I really recommend this disc and believe that the Eroica quartet has a bright future ahead of itself. And that what they do today...will shape the sound of tommorow!"
"Ok i gotta say Christopher's(chris) book Eragon may have given away future plots in the story but you always had to guess when they came.i mean don't you people think it's nice to know how things work?and yes you may be able to tell he was real young when wrote Eragon but for some fantasy books that i've read by 40 year old people Eragon had way way more action.and about the whole crying thing,if you acctually read the book you would understand that Eragon had alot of pain in his life and to top it all off it was all happing at the same time.First with people he loved dieing, and losing good friends for a while.come on people show some sympathy.so to conclude my review I give it a two thumbs up,Chris could have done a little better but that's what practice is for right?But if this goes against what you think DEAL WITH IT!"
"I was really surprised that there was another Nevada book by Zane Grey. I had originally wanted another copy of the first book, Nevada, but when I saw this one I just had to buy it. Thanks!"
"Multiple pages missing ie, blank.Had taken this book on vacation to Spain and was disappointed as I could not completely read few stories The pages were blank.Fist bad experience of a purchase from Amazon."
The warmer keeps the cup at an acceptable temperature and looks great on the desk. The warming light is very useful in reminding me if the unit is on or off. I could not be more pleased with this product and the cost was perfect.
This product really sticks. I bought a couple days ago and then had to return it. I couldn't even set up the VNP because there was no proper documentation. I call Netgear and their support was no help at all. The router couldn't work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine... without reset the router... What I am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired LAN cable... you would not have a connection. Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully. The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1.2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you cannot call them (Netgear).... you have to email .... beta@netgear.com or something like that. It does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches. Hope this review helps.
"First thing's first, ""Homespun"" is an album of demos for ""Apple Venus"". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, ""Skylarking"" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for ""Apple Venus"". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places (""Frivolous Tonight"") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts ""River of Orchids"" and ""Green Man"".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original (""Knights in Shining Karma""), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out ""Apple Venus"", it's a fine record."
"I have shoulder length curly, fine hair. I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair. The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair. But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool. It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get. I will be returning this styler ASAP. Very unhappy."
"This movie is So very bad on so many different levels, that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it. Madonna is at her all time low, and it is a low that few stars ever reach. She is a terribly bad actress and this time out, she made even her die-hard fans cringe in embarassment for her. Simply put, there is no guesswork here...there is not a redeaming quality in this movie. The acting, script, direction, tone, pace, etc., are all at an extremely shoddy level, and DAMN is she getting painful to look at. The only comfort comes in the knowledge of the FACT that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well. Even Madonna's legion of fans couldn't get her out of this one. It bombed on every level."
Loved the book! Read it in 5 days. The condition was as advertised by the seller. Would recommend it to other people.
"I was ok with ordering this inexpensive mask for my son because I thought it would come with the tinted glass that is shown, because that's all he really wants. It's unfortunate that these fly by night paintball companies take advantage of people advertising one product but actually delivering another. Last time I order anything from this company."
"I love this group's early feel-good canadian rock n' roll, but I stumbled onto this album in a music store in the mall. With excitement, I sampled all the songs and to my disappointment, I still can't figure out what the hit was suppose to be. It's really terrible so don't bother. Just stick to their old stuff. Their 80's stuff rocks!!"
"I read this for the first time about 2 years ago. And when the books' free....This book (and the books after it) were great. Lousia May Alcott made 4 girls, that seem real. 4 girls with problems that girls have now.I especially loved the bond that the March family had. How happy they were when their father came home....Wonderful book. 5 stars."
"This book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process. For the good student, this book will confirm what he or she already knows and may add a few additional touches to personal trouble spots. For the average to poor student, it may be hard to get past the school marmish tone to get to ""the goods"" this book has to offer. I'm afraid in today's environment, this book won't reach those who need it the most."
"The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit, I guess). What a turn-off."
"It is a great suit, great buy, great service all around! I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a Frosty suit to buy one of these."
"This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included, just because I enjoyed their banter and potential. I recommend to any modern romance fan."
"Given the variance in reviews, at best, I'd say this is an unreliable product. (I saw the mixed reviews before ordering, but figured ""they couldn't be that bad."")First of all, the battery was NOT a BB battery -- not as pictured nor made in Japan (it was plain silver and made in China).The battery I received wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. I sent an e-mail complaint; was told that sometimes a given battery won't be up to snuff; and they would exchange. The second battery lasted a little longer but not even 24 hours. I gave up. I had made a bad bet. I just didn't want to bother with them any more. I used it for a couple of months -- having to charge it once or twice a day. It declined steadily and finally flat-lined this week. Ironically, I'm now using my old battery which seems brilliant compared to my recent experiences.Maybe you'll get lucky, but the odds are against you."
"Beautiful book. Cover and art are incredible. Very proud to display in home. This is a great, quick read and this edition is very nice."
"The following disclaimer appears on the ""Unfit for Command"" Swift boat book:""Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!""Why is there no such disclaimer issued for this book? It seems that Amazon's political bias is showing! Shame! Shame! Shame!Until this same disclamer appears under ""Tour of Duty"" I will take my book buying business elsewhere!"
I thought this was going to be a live performance from KENNY G.instead this was just a recording with a fire place burning not what i was expecting.
"First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT, unless you love sleeping on the beach with nothing between you and clumpy, gritty sand, don't buy them. After several washings the fabric is truly so rough that it hurts. There is a fatal flaw- the fabric- and the manufacturer must change it if it wants repeat customers. Summary: fit is fantastic, sheets are terrible. Don't buy them."
"Awesome Camcorder & Camera functions in this lightweight, easy to use camcorder make it a breeze to shoot great memories for a novice like me, right out of the box. This camcorder also has a huge selection of special effects, and options to make really interesting video effects. I love this camcorder!"
The DVD will not play. It goes thru the process of downloading until the last point & then says that it is not programed for downloading. I would like to send it back for a DVD that will play.
"I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens, and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking, smoking, engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism, having sex with girls between the age of 12 and 15, and stealing from their parents.This was a huge waste of an hour and a half. I only gave this movie 1 star because amazon doesn't allow me to give it 0.If you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens, and is GOOD, Thirteen is the movie you wanna watch."
"Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable, I just wish it was a little higher. I would recommend this product."
My daughter loves all the Spiderman movies and I bought her one through three for Christmas... can't beat the price!
"I loved Lutz's earlier book (American Nervousness), and this one is also a great accomplishment. More than any literary scholar I have read, Lutz is able to use literature to bring great insight to particular social and cultural issues. He also writes well."
"When I put this on my car visor, it was visually distracting and made me feel claustrophobic! Having 30 CDs hanging over my head is just not a good idea. I tried to give it to my husband, but he thought the same thing, and got a smaller one that holds 10 CDs. Much better."
"This movie is for you if -(a.) you are over 20 and still read comic books(b.) believe that someone would believe that taking a blue pill would make them a superman(c.) then spend their life trying to enact their powers contrary to all reality telling them otherwise(d.) find humor in the situations that people with reduced mental functioning find themselves(e.) and don't know that, unless distorted, the reality of such individuals is too mundane for a movie(f.) and that some cheaply made movies are not made to convey an altruistic message but to make money."
"First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!"
"This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the ""dumbing of America"" that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country)."
"A mysterious creature is haunting the seas, and Professor Aronnax is determined to discover the origins of the beast. However, the encounter brings more than he ever expected, as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the world's oceans. The aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul, while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at large.Verne's underwater adventure is the latest novel I have read to my toddler at bedtime, and is far from my favorite. As we finished the third Verne novel we have approached I found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose; I found that the language was flat and uninspired, and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy. The failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders, and I believe we will leave Verne buried once and for all."
"I read previous reviews of this DVD set, and almost didn't buy it because of the negative reviews. I was basically getting it for free, so I figured I might as well.I understand where the others are coming from regarding the item being digitally remastered, but if you really enjoy the classics, then you'll love this DVD set. My wife & I have watched several of the cartoons, and they bring back great memories of when we were kids. I don't care that it's not digitally remastered. Would it be nice? Yes, but I wouldn't let that stop you from getting this set."
"We brought this baby home, expecting the most. Boy, did we get it. It was one of those nights: Clarance and Arnold are ""on their way"", six others were expected. I had an amazing recipe from Marie Curie (Spanish salad!) and Ken had squeezed the juice clean from the cranberry. We threw the table together, and after some simple instructions (and not less than two stubbed thumbs) we were in ""biz""! I would decide to tell anyone that this tool really has something for everyone. Pleased customer."
"I am a fast reader by nature, but this book took months to get through. Although she made some good points, I think it's pretty much what every other book out there says."
I find that the 4th season was not as good as the previous ones. I love all the characters but I did not like Shane moving on so quickly with Paige. She seem to be more the person that Carmen wanted but without Carmen.
"This is a good quality game and it's played a lot in our household. We play one-person ""Mahjong"" very often here (maybe too often?) and everyone from the adults to the 8 year old is hooked on this particular game. There's a two person version as well, but it's not as big of hit in our household. The graphics on the tiles are detailed, so this may not be a game for laptop size screens, but works just fine on regular larger monitors. You've also got the option to choose different tile graphics and layouts, which might help. One reason we purchased it is so that it could be played both on the Mac and the MS PC and it does that well. It has some fun sounds as the tiles are matched and removed. If you have the CD in, you get the sounds. Without the CD, no cute sounds, but the game goes faster, so it depends on what you want. I like the quality, the flexibility, and the challenge of the Mahjong game offered in this CD."
Real kettle popcorn is sweetened with sugar and is a real tasty snack.Unfortunately sugar burns in the microwave so Orville Redenbacher (ConAgra Foods) have sweetened this with sucralose.Sucralose is definitely something I wouldn't give to my kid. Read all about it online.
"Ok, lets get this right out in the open for some of the other reviewers that do not know what they are talking about. John Carpenter, had NOTHING to do with this movie. The only one he ever had anything to do with was the orginal. Which by the way is by far the best of the bunch. I don't really even count the others at all. Well, maybe the second one, it wasn't too bad.As for this movie, I'll be honest I've never even watched it. I guess I'll rent it someday and see what it's all about. At least it doesn't have Michael Myers in it, which is good, cause in my opinion he died after the second movie. I do think they should of changed the name of this though. I mean, every Halloween movie has had a different director, naming this one part III doesn't even make any sense at all."
"The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand ""new"" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged). I can't imagine using them for metal, let alone most rubbers. Despite the very affordable price, I would NOT have purchased this set for the above reasons."
If you need a home light duty printer that provides professional laser printed documents perhaps say for a small home business or a private laser printer for an executive's office this is perfect. It is not for huge jobs or big projects but for the little jobs that need professional flair.
Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
"Our Shiba Inu, Maya, loves these. First and foremost, the packaging says Made in the USA and that makes them worth buying right there. They are quite light and airy (being freeze dried) and are easy to crunch or gum for older dogs. A definite go to treat for any canine companion."
"C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no f-----g reason. As little as possible. All the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night, hold up bars just because there are black people there, and reapeatedly getting the same food as 24 minutes ago. And a point that should go out, THERE IS NO CAR CHASE! Just someone chasing a train! I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars! BYE!"
"I have read several of Steinbeck's other works. They are generally good. This book, although, is slow moving and has several irrelevant chapters thrown in. The ending is definitely not what I expected."
"I'll keep it short and sweet. This product is garbage. I purchased a vinyl cover to further protect the item, but it became a rust bucket and fell to pieces. The company's response: we'll send you $50. Nice. Don't waste your time & money. Keep looking."
"i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country , so i had to cancel. My baby never had problem with these diapers.thanks."
I got a VHScopy that did not work on my video player.I was able to return to the sender.I would have liked to get the new DVD copy but found it too costly.It was a good tv series and book and Isaw it quite a long time ago.It's to bad that the cost is high.Ron
I thought it was slow and predictable. Tobey was good as Spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot. I don't get it why everyone likes Spiderman so much it's not that good of a movie. I didn't like the first one much either both Spiderman movies suck and I hope the 3rd one will be better but it will probably be the same as the first two. It's in my opinion if I didn't like it don't get mad why I didn't like it I just didn't like it.
"This is the most horrible excuse for a movie that I have ever witnessed, and I want my two hours that I wasted seeing this back."
The Institute for American Indian Studies did not review this book. The attributed review originated with the author.
"Whoever digitized this book was not paying attention. There are header lines (title and author)in the middle of the screen, text lines end in the middle, page numbers appear in the middle of paragraphs.I like this author and would, perhaps, enjoy this story if there weren't so many distractions due to poor editing. Save your money until someone fixes this version!"
"How nice to reread an old classic as an adult, instead of in the classroom. A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his ""great expectations"" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted ""daughter"" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best."
"I rode the Foundations course and found that I was within my target heart rate for 24 minutes total. Instructor gives encouragement and tips for staying focused on the ride. If you turn off the lights and spin, its almost the same as being in a live class."
"I am sorry but this album was not what I was hoping it would be. I purchased it as a child and own it now as an adult. However, the only reason I do own it was because they attached their videos on DVD. We like it (Wild & Loose) and Juicy Gothca Krazy are great songs but only in there video forms. If you are looking for those sames songs as released on video on CD you aren't going to find it. Sad to say but I feel the only reason this album really sold was because many saw the videos first and then purchased the album hoping to hear the same thing."
"These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD. If you need a ""shot"" in the romance department, one or more of these songs should do it."
"The Cd is a disgrace, I almost laughed out lad at the singers voice. If youre in need of a few laughs then buy this- if you like music by any rage album! This CD doesnt deserve a star. The music doesnt compare to rage at all."
"Blanket was too big in the large size for 21 inch baby at 9 lbs. They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need. The velcro tabs are small and she could easily slip out. I'm waiting until the baby is bigger to use it, but we're in the third month and still waiting. Other reviews have said the small was too small, so I'm not sure. Would recommend Miracle Blanket; costs more but is one-size fits all and is adjustable as they grow. Just don't put it in the dryer..."
Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
Bought 2 of these with the idea of keeping one and giving the other to my mother. Neither worked well and failed soon after using. The seller was magnificent and refunded our money.
"I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason, I liked Christopher Lambert, and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man, was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called ""top talent"" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes. I mean, I tried really hard to be open-minded, but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire, put on some quiet music, and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did."
"Our Father Abraham: Jewish Roots of the Christian FaithA book every Christian should read. We cannot fully understand the teachings of Jesus and our Bible without a through knowledge of Jewish history and culture. We worship a Jewish savior, who worshiped in a synagogue, honored and practiced Jewish rituals. We read from a Jewish book, our Bible written by Jewish men. To fully understand the symbolism in the Bible we must know something about Jewish religeous practices.Christianity is a branch attached to a tree that has its roots in Judaism This book is one of the best available for a deeper understanding of Jewish culture and religeon. I highly reccomend this book to all Christains wishing to have a deeper understanding of their faith and its beginnings."
"It's the truth that early Mormon leaders told fanciful tales about Moon Men and the Lost Ten Tribes . . . to their kids at bedtime. It seems there's a difference between what a Mormon leader says from the puplit as official doctrine, and what they say having fun with their family. It's the same with anyone. This book takes snippets from private journals and attempts to pass them off as official doctrine. As a How-To Book, this one just doesn't work.A better book to buy from Amazon on this subject is Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass : The Art of Telling Tales About Joseph Smith and Brigham Young (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 11) . Hugh Nibley, David J. Whittaker (Editor) / Hardcover / Published 1991"
"As always, Gerard Durrell's works make me want to hop on a flight to Greece right now. His imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone, especially small boys. Though it was an enjoyable read, it seemed a bit too similar to My Family and Other Animals, as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one, which is exactly what the author states in the introduction. This book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals, less on the comical family, and though sea life is fascination, crustaceans do get a bit old. This book is very relaxing to read, and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again. Slow paced and funny, this enjoyable book put Corfu at the top of my list of places to go."
"I've been using the carafe for 3 months, and generally speaking a pleasure to use. it's decently constructed (though by no means heavy duty), and it's lasted so far, even though I'm not gentle on things.My only real complain is that because the carafe narrows at the top, and it's rather tall, it's hard to clean the bottom without a brush."
"seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read ""the hobbit,"" i was able to watch it and laugh more often than i felt appaled.the film lacks the quiet dignity of the book and feels heavy-handed. watching it i could only think of the phrase, ""bilbo gump."" the progress the character of bilbo makes in the book is lost in film and we are left with a hero who wanders through his various adventures, which apparently have very little effect on anything aside from his financial situation. and as an extra side-note, the music feels ridiculous."
"Cain CoxELA 8The Hobbit/JRR TolkienBook review10/1/03The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo. In the book the hobbit gets taken on the adventure of his life.In one of his adventures he meets some trolls that have a cave behind them and he is sent to look in the cave to look. But before he can get into the cave he gets caught by the trolls. The only reason that he was alive was that a wizard saves him.I thought that this was an exciting and adventurers book. It had a great plot and a great story about wizards, hobbits, dwarfs, goblins, dragons and elves. If you like that kid of thing you should read it. It's great for all ages.The hobbit was a great book with a fabulous plot. So if you like adventures you should read the book the hobbit by JRR Tolkien. I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy."
We love this magazine. My husband and I are planning a move to Maine and this magazine is a fun read for us.
I wanted a pretty band with sparkle cause I hate to have a raised up stone with little ones for the scratching. But this ring is perfect. Smooth and shiny.
"I have told all of my girlfriends single and married about this book. It is right on point and gives very good insight into the males ways of thinking and how we should interact with them. We as women sometimes lose our identity to please a man and it never works. I have always held my own in a relationship for the most part, but I have found new insights into loving myself and loving my man without losing myself in the relationship and have found it totally true that a man appreciates a woman more when she stands up for herself, has a live apart from him and does not make him her world but a part of her world. I can hardly wait to read why men MARRY bitches."
"The year was 1999. I was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie. You know, one of those utterly bland suburban campuses. Our company had just hired ""efficiency consultants"" to ""analyze"" the business. Then one day a bunch of people get laid off. While there, management introduced a new phone system for tracking how we spent our time. We actually had to enter a code to use the bathroom so they could know how much time we were there.I remember sitting in the movie theater, not sure whether I should laugh or cry. Now 5 years later I can definitely laugh. I love the bit about the TPS report memo and the red stapler. Lots of rough language, but otherwise a real gem."
"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the ""evils"" of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"
"Not the book it should be. I am very disappointed since i got the wrong item. Please do not sell books to people if you are not giving what is shown. On a positive note, I understand we all make mistakes! Please dont do this again however to anyone besides myself. Honesty really is the best policy! God bless you!!!"
"What a bummer. First off, it was late getting here even though it was sent 2-day Prime. So it barely made it for Christmas. The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD. It skipped in SEVERAL places. Brand new out of the case, first time in the player, and it skipped. The quality of the movie is awful too. You'd think if it was that bad to begin with, it wouldn't have been transferred to a DVD to begin with... :/"
"I read a lot of negative reviews about the purchase of high end, expensive perfumes at Amazon Website; however, since this one was being sold by amazon.com itself, I decided to take a risk. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. The fragrance is so subtle that even a person standing one foot away cannot appreciate it------------and that is immediately after putting it on! Complete waste of money."
"Your ears will thank you for buying this album. You can really chill out to it with all the musical styles covered - pop, techno, rock but where it really shines is the bluesy gospel/electronic fusion with the awesome tracks Natural Blues & Run On, yes I love the blues but you don't have to be biased towards any particular type of music to enjoy this album as it cleverly mixes most genres. Easily 5 stars as I can't think of any weak points on this."
"When I bought the TiVo, I was told that this item would tape 2 different programs at the same time. When it didn't work, I called that company and they told me that because I had DirectTV, it was impossible to use the TiVo like I wanted to. I was totally cheated. I then bought the DirectTV's type of Digital REcorder, and it's the best thing I've ever done. It records 2 different programs at exactly the same time. TiVo told me that it only works on Cable. Bah Humbug. This is NOT explained when you want to buy the item. Buyers Beware"
"Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto ""Sci-fi Wasabi"" on a CMJ sampler, I bought STEREOTYPE A thinking it might have other songs in the same vein. Much to my dismay, it honestly is a boring album. Nearly the songs sound the same, and the singing of Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda is inept and lazy.Cibo Matto, like several other Japanese artists (most notably Towa Tei), tried to use the American fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album. In the end, all one gets is a collection of 14 yawn-inducing filler-pop tracks. It has no redeeming qualities, and I would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on."
"My husband is using this book for his management class, so I'm giving you a second-hand review. I asked him how he liked the book, and the title of this review was his response. He's a man of few words, but the bottom line is that he finds the textbook very user-friendly, and it has benefited him a great deal in his class."
"All of the Harry Potter movies (as well as the books) are artless adolescent, ""no-rules"" fantasy composed of pubescent cultural drek of interest only to those newly familiarizing themselves with incipient secretions of estrogen and testosterone. Mature adults, stay away unless you consider gagging and retching forms of entertainment.The most recent (...Goblet of Fire) is actually the worst - mostly for the length of time (2.5 hrs.) it takes to pass. Rawlings is no Tolkien, and director Newell provided no improvements. The special effects - especially flying - are too fast and furious to be appreciated as anything but blurs. If you must see this travesty, complete the experience with stale popcorn."
"Some wear and tear on the case, but other than that the DVD itself works great, thanks so much :)"
"This movie is the best one I have ever seen. I have the soundtrack and it's great too. The story, dancing and music is unbelievable!! I think everyone should see this at least once in their life!!"
"I like em a lot, wife thinks they're the best cereal she's ever had, teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food, the others here like them enough. Bags are pretty small but still a good enough deal that I'll buy again, just too good (and a unique flavor...really like the pumpkin seeds in them) not to."
"This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too."
"After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP's support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also."
"It's sad, but it happens - bootleg CDs get put up for sale on Amazon and they can't remove them fast enough. I commented on two other bootleg sales and can't find them any longer, obviously Amazon took them down and new identical ones came and took their place. Some people just don't have any shame at all.If you're going to call on Amazon to remove these CDs, you should rather suggest that they blacklist the seller, remove any means to buy the item and mark it as fake. That way, no customer would ever have to be fooled again."
"I was thrilled to finally receive my book The Sailors' Valentine. It's a unique book about an old art using shells. The sailors of a century and more ago created the Valentines for their sweethearts. The pictures are fantastic and the octagon shape of the book makes it a perfect table book. I could not find this out-of-print book anywhere but on Amazon.com. I received it in it's original sealed box: it was new listed in the used book section. Thanks, Amazon!"
"I've had a Garmin Quest for many years and have used it throughout the U.S. and Europe on many trips. I bought the Nuvi 670 for my other cars. It has improved antenna sensitivity to work better in a city environment, pre-loaded U.S. and European maps, clearer and enhanced voice instructions as well as blue tooth and other features make this a really enjoyable and useful product."
These guys really are great. Too bad they broke up before they could really big. they're big but i mean REALLY big. I'm planning on buying this album once i'm not broke. I've litened to thier free mp3s on mp3.com and they are really good. I look forward to the purchasing of this album.
"This may be the best book ever written by a human being. Next to the Bible and Shakespeare, there are few better books. This is one of the first books I ever read on the chronic pain problems around the world, and how to get over them. Her work with people suffering from chronic pain is an inspiration to writers everywhere. The stories of people being misdiagnosed as ""simply depressed"" was insightful. It is a clear, and easy to read book. Yet it has many detailed facts, and interviews. I was suffering from chronic pain greatly when I read this, and her chapters on herbal vitamins to take helped me greatly! I was very moody before, and this helped without drugs! Her tips on how to write about your pain to help get outside your pain very insightful. I loved this book, and I think it is a great work for anyone dealing with chronic pain."
"I have 4 Tivo's in the house and each uses a different type of WiFi adaptor. I bought the Tivo AG0100 to connect my Series 2 to my Linksys Router in 2007 to replace a Linksys adaptor to get better speed. Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1/2 years and died suddenly. I giving two stars because it did not last very long. The other WiFi adaptors (Linksys and Microsoft) are still working and they are older. I do want to note that the Tivo WiFi adaptor runs hot, while the others are not even warm."
"This is a fantastic CD, and again, one of my favourties. I can remember hearing tracks from this in the early 1980's, and thinking how great they were. I ordered a ""used"" one from Amazon, and it plays perfectly. If you like Tango music, then I think you will enjoy this."
"The Song Continues is an updated version of Horne's earlier My Life. Much of the text is the same. Even so, we needed an update, didn't we? For having a kind of ""take no prisoners"" style, Horne is pretty generous with foes as well as friends. (She doesn't re-tell the Sills/Scala incident here.) There are some new pictures, which is wonderful. Even more wonderful, and almost worth the purchase price all on its own, is the bonus CD. There are 18 songs on the CD. While they don't come up in chronological order, they are generally arranged earlier to later; you can still get the feeling for how that miraculous instrument evolved. I'm glad I have both books."
"As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
"This was their first true recording project, although it was thier second full album. I give this album four stars, because, though I love this album and this band, Five stars would mean it's an album that stands next to Physical Graffitti, the White Album, and a select few other records. This album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what Sabbath, Hendrix, and Zeppelin started. An album worth the money, with many great songs and performances. If there are any criticisms, one would be the production. It leaves some room for improvement. Beyond that, I hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come. Purchas and enjoy!"
"I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed."
I love these diapers. i have been using it for my son during the day. with the discounts and and all others amazon coupons i got this for a very decent price. i think 50% discount is very good. its been almost a month and i still have half of the box to be used.
These are very pretty but I did not use them on my tree since they look more hot pink than red. In a few years as I add more colors to my tree I will have them.
Having grown up with Bugs Bunny I am pleased to see they are still going. My son laughs out loud when we watch it.
"Dr. Hahn has performed yet another great service for the Church (and the whole world, for that matter). The Our Father is Gospel prayer, the prayer that Jesus Himself gave to us. If prayer is oxygen for the soul, then Dr. Hahn has helped to breathe life into our prayer. In the light of four Fathers of the Church, as well as his own excellent insights, Dr. Hahn, a teacher in the Teacher, teaches us how to pray."
"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."
"My son and I started reading parts of this in the car on a trip. We are both aficionados of anything mythological, and encountering these profound, rich, and unusual stories has been inspiring to both of us (but probably most inspiring to my son). The stories we have read so far are presented both as myths, but also as possibilities, expanding the idea of what might have been and what might be, offering also a window of insight into the times in which the myths were captured. The myths are largely framed within the context of the Christian and Roman Catholic Church and culture, and do reveal some of the bias of the times against the Jews and Judaic faith. While not politically correct, this is a solid well-written work with much education potential, if placed in context and not read as a sole work on the topic. One of the best free books I've gotten for the Kindle!"
This novel takes you from a warm fire to the icy wastes and carries you on a wild flight to survive the elements and overcome the threat to innocent travellers. A excellent adventure with a unexpected ending.
"With an emphasis on the ""fiction"" part! This could've been a really good novel but it fell way short. I guess I just prefer historical fiction to be well, historical!"
Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (highshcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
"For those familiar with the Burzum name, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is largely and widely accepted as his crowning achievement. Utilizing a stunning mixture of layered guitar melodies, gloomy synths, and thunderous percussion, Varg works his way through three hypnotic metal songs before the ambitious ambient outro - Tomhet. Rather than sit here and rattle on about the magic contained within this record, I would rather just claim that it is a must have for any black metal fan, and ranks among the highest calibur or metal releases period."
"This album features a large English chorus singing traditional Christmas songs. Songs are sung not just in English, but also in French and German. It's certainly well sung, but it's pretty boring to my ears. Most of the songs don't have that much energy, other than the bombastic ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"". But fans of classical music will probably enjoy it more than me."
"I had bought one of these for my old dog (a large German Shorthaired Pointer) who had a horrible pulling problem. And it worked perfectly for him, and he didn't seem to mind. On the other hand I just bought one of these for my 10 month old Coonhound, and it also worked to stop his pulling. But he hates it! I can't take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast 3-6 times. I think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up, but now I have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him. Other than that amazing product in it's self."
"Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was "" Wow Wicked Brilliant !"""
"I enjoyed Anderson's book, especially the background into Tolkien's sources and early writings that is invaluable. I must say I have read the Hobbit at least 100 times and yet I have never enjoyed reading it as much as when I read it with Anderson's anotations. I especially appreciated the philological background into the many proper names and archaic words that Tolkien used. What is a ""carrock""or what does ""confusticate and bebother"" mean? Now I know!I also enjoyed the immense number of illustrations that were included, many of them sketches and pictures made by J.R.R himself. Alas, they are not in color, most are black and white prints of original color pictures. If more had been invested in the visual quality of this book, it would have greatly added to the level of pleasure in the words of Tolkien that Anderson's comments bring out. Still worth the money, hopefully Anderson will add color in the next edition"
"If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $3.99 plus $0.99(per item) return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this ""quality""?"
"....I think this thing is sortof nice the way it has an integrated Tape and CD, but generally I think it is really crappy compared to the Turtle Beach Audiotron. Granted that unit is designed to be connected to a real stereo, and not imitate a real stereo like this unit, but the support for formats, and features is 400% better on that unit.The Audiotron is also able to play icecast and shoutcast..."
"The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome, but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game."
This is a great book about a thirteen-year-old boy named Mark. Mark is hiking across the desert where he stumbles upon a mysterious light. As Mark touches it he ends up in a whole new world. Grass and plants are red and animals are different. Also there are new types of humans. Now Mark must use everything he knows to survive and to find the mysterious light to get back home.This book has a lot of action in it and it keeps you wandering the whole time. That is one of the reasons I like this book. The only thing I didn't like is the book just kind of stops at the end. It is a great book though. I can compare this book to a lot of books Will Hobbs writes because they both have a lot of action. I could also compare this book to any survival books because Mark has to survive. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Will Hobbs or loves action and adventure!
"Talk about beating a dead horse. How much further can the Freddy thing get stretched? The idea of a character from the movies 'becoming real because he was so evil' is ludicrous at best. It would be like walking into 7-11 and bumping into Darth Vadar as you were filling up your Big Gulp. Robert Englund was happy to make this I'm sure, I mean after awhile people started calling him Freddy everywhere he went. What else was he gonna do, make Cereal or Laundry Soap commercials? Stick with the original series, this was stupid."
"I bought this product for the girlfriend, who happens to be be a smoker. Her car always smelled really bad, abviously. I purchased this to try and curb the smell and surprisingly, despite the small size of this product it works very well. Keeps the car smelling fresh even after being smoked in."
"Queen played in 1982 with new sounds; The result was an entertaining record, however much called die hard fans criticized it."
"Pretty pictures, intriguing idea, but little information to back it up. What was the methodology? Have the results been replicated? Where is the science here? Lightweight."
"I know that this movie got ""mixed reviews,"" whatever that means, but I found it charming and sweet and rather touching at some parts. I enjoyed the DVD for all the extras, too. I loved listening to Hugh Jackman with a different accent than his native Australian, and the oh so proper English accent he used in that other romantic movie he was recently in.""Someone. . ."" touches on so many emotions, and Ashley Judd is funny and manic, and her comic timing is great. I am very happy that I bought this movie. Don't miss the cheerleader scene. Hugh Jackman was gorgeous."
"Cha Cha Mix is definitely tasty, but don't buy it in bulk here because it turns rancid and you can't return food to Amazon. The first few bags were super but bag five, which was still in code, tasted nasty, as did bag six. I didn't open any more and contacted Harmony and they sent me a coupon for a free bag but that doesn't make up for the eight yucky ones I'm stuck with."
"I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging. This seemed perfect, but the dryer is so weak, it takes forever to dry my hair and virtually no straightening effect. After using it, I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron. So I've gone back to drying my hair with a regular dryer (more power and therefore faster) and using the flat iron. I guess I should have known it sounded too good to be true."
I had an earlier model of this hot water dispenser for eleven years. That one had a metal container which rusted out. This newer version has a molded plastic type of water container which is definitely an improvement. I love the addition of the temperature control which the old one did not have.
"Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally, for effect it seems, but to no discernible advantage. However, there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot - no doubt grist for a successful movie - where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers. In toto, an very unenjoyably read."
"In all fairness, I wasn't able to finish this novel. The author seems to have a singular obsession with things sexual to the exclusion of most of the important characteristics of a good story.If you like the theme of a woman's sexual liberation, read Chopin's _The Awakening_ or Lawrence's _Lady Chatterley's Lover_ instead. (Besides, the sex is much better in _LCL_.) In addition to tackling this controversial subject, these books are masterfully written and classics for all time."
I was in 9th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed. In my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author(Steinbeck). It takes place in the early 1900's where 2 friends find a job helping out on a farm. They meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems. Throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream. All around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who hasn't yet read it.
Received the book in a timely fashion but the CD-ROM and the Timeline were NOT included. This should have been clearly stated in the listing! The Timeline was to be a 60th birthday present for my twin sister.
Stanley Tam believed in principles and in his faith. His story is truly amazing and his success cannot be disputed. Regardless of your faith or lack thereof the author does a great job in humbly recapping his lifetime achievements for our benefit. Give him a chance to tell you his story. I believe only good things will come of it.
Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.
"Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose."
"She started out as the ""German Britney Spears"" and somehow she got stuck there. Her songs have no message, no great melody and are absolutely shallow. So is her image. She still stays ""clean"" (in contrast to Britney) and it extremely boring and superficial (when it comes to stardom - no meant personally)"
"I will not usually recommend a mono CD unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative. Well, there are many recent CDs filled with ""the antique music,"" but none bear up so well as the Amadeus reissue of the 1961 <Instrumental Music of 1600> (AMD 7007) as performed by the Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the man who was one of the pioneers of ""period instruments"" in recordings. Here we have 23 cuts of music from France (du Tertre, du Caurroy), England (Holborne, Morley, Tomkins, Cooper, Bevin), Germany (Sommer, Posch, Scheidt), and Italy (Cabrielli, Gumai, Massaino), all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound. I will deduct a rating-point, however, for its short running time of 46 minutes. But all in all, this is gorgeous music gorgeously played."
"Ordered two, and billed for two, as Christmas presents. Received one, which was a misassembled plastic piece of garbage. Oh well, my fault for buying jewelry over the net. Should, at least, receive what I ordered, however. So I wrote the dealer to either send the second one or issue a refund. Never could get a reply. Threw the one that had arrived in the trash. Would have given this a negative rating, if ""1"" were not the lowest number available."
"The original Bosch fuel pump died in my 1991 Saturn after 20 years of service. a Replacement part was $600, for a 20 year old car. No thank YOU! I replaced it with a Walbro pump, bought on Amazon. Let's be honest, dropping the tank and replacing the pump is not a fun thing to do and you don't want to do it again any time soon. In installing the new pump in the old housing it makes no sense not to replace the strainer as well, the old one in my car was yellow, somewhat brittle after doing its job for 20 years. Some fuel pump makers will not warrant the replacement pump unless you replace this part as well- I can understand that as it is not hard to imagine pieces of a disintegrating strainer being sucked up and constricting the pump mechanism. Hey, if you are going to spend money on a pump, and the time to pull it spend the few extra bucks to do it right so that you don't have to do it again soon."
I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!
I fell in love with clay the first day he auditioned on AI. He is not only adorable he as a AWESOME voice!! girls are crazy over him!! and this CD is SOO GREAT!!IT'S BEAUTIFUL!! I LOVE CLAY SOO MUCH and if u say that you can't stand him then why are you wasting time reviewing over him??JELOUSY!!! : )Keep it up claymates! he has already gone double platinum!!! WOOWOO!
Loved kindle for iPad can't go wrong I buy as many books as possible this way. Quick down load and you get your stuff right away
"This book is incredible. So he wrote this book in like 1950's I believe? and hes writing about 1984.. about the future.. and he was right.. he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people.. about how the government uses propaganda, how the government watches the people, listens to the people.. this book is good if you care about the world. this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it. this book is good if you are someone who doesn't want to be controlled or fooled.kindof like the way we are today sadly.."
"This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original, the acting is horrific, the swordfighting utterly ridiculous.The scene that sums it all up is when the guards won't chase after a carriage going about 1 mph and everyone escapes.I have no idea how on earth anyone could make a movie so terrible. Extremely torturous to watch. Do not buy it, do not rent it. In fact, just read the book, which is awesome."
"Ok, a few years ago, I worked for a major HMO last year. I was also confined to a small gray cubicle for 8 hours a day. And after watching Office Space, I quit a month later. Coincidence? Maybe. But it was like watching my life unfold on screen! Like having 4 bosses ""remind"" you about a tiny mistake that doesn't really matter, the doggone fax machine that is your sworn enemy, and of course the office FREAK, who you know is gonna someday show up to the work place armed! This movie has it all, and it's hilarious! So, if you ever get a case of the ""mondays"", call in sick,blow off those dang TPS reports, and watch this movie!"
"OMG!! This was TERRIFIC! I was so pleased that all the actors/actresses from ""TL, TW, ATW"" came back to Prince Caspian!!! It was awesome... the sword fights, the battles, the waking of the trees, Reepicheep, and the bits of humor mixed in here and there! I loved it!"
A gripping in depth story which historically records the training and emotional depth of those who choose to become key players in the medical community.A must read which will jar your emotions and expose the drama the determination and dedication of those who want to be contributors in the medical revolution.
"I really liked this book. The beginning was kind of slow, but if you keep on reading you can't put it down. I really like how he used the main character as a hobbit (or really small person), instead of this tall, masculine person, who works on a farm, and all the chicks dig him, because people like that have ""a really hard time proving themselves"".That why I like The Hobbit, because Bilbo proved himself even though he's three foot tall.It shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character. We could be four foot five and two hundred pounds outside, but a seven foot high one hundred forty pound body builder inside."
"It's amazing that a book this bad could have been published. It consists of one maudlin cliche after another. The widowed Jennifer, who miscarried her dead husband's child, has to deal with her beloved grandmother having a stroke. She meets someone who could be ""the one"" for her, but -- oops! -- he has a brain tumor and is likely to die. The writing is amateurish, full of telling instead of showing. The only reason I finished it was because I was trapped on vacation in a cabin with nothing else to read."
"We got a big box of ""baby dry"" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand, the ""swaddlers"" take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes. We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers."
"I saw Joseph for the first time about 4 years ago, and wondered why I waited so long to see it. I took my older children (then aged 8 & 9) to see it two years later--they loved it, too! They insisted I buy the soundtrack CD (also an awesome thing to have), and now my three year old bops around the house singing, ""Go, go, go Joseph!"" Good music, great lyrics, a great evening for the entire family! A must for Andrew Lloyd Weber fans of all ages."
"claudia and shea are both in trouble at school. If they fail one more language test, she may not past the sunject. so what they do is to help each other and that's where they become friends."
"When I ordered this book, I expected it to be a defense of the Protestant position of Sola Scriptura, but to my surprise it is instead aimed at correcting liberal Christian views of how we form relationships with God. The book opens with a story of a Christian woman who was waiting for God to tell her directly that she should make amends with her estranged parents, when a friend told her to open her Bible to Exodus 20:12 and read.The book proceeds in this direction emploring the reader to use his or her Bible as a means to form a personal relationship with God rather than expecting God to speak by direct revelation. It also briefly defends the authority of the Bible against such attacks as higher criticism and the Jesus Seminar.Despite the ""Why"" in the title, I would have to say that it is more pastoral than apologetic. Even so, I recommend it."
"My thrifty (stingy) friend who'd not even throw away month-old newspapers gave me this CD, and told me I could keep it. I should have been suspicious of this unexpected generosity...My hunch was right on... Every song sounds the same, stale, corny and sleep-inducing. I'd rather re-read month-old newspapers-unless I have trouble sleeping, then I'll whip out the CD and I know I'll fall asleep within 2 songs, or faster."
"I was originally looking forward to seeing this movie, but after I did, I wish I hadn't spent the money. The story is lame, the actors dull, and the story is so changed from Shirley Jackson's wonderful book, and the 1963 movie that it doesn't even deserve to share the same title. Forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older 'Haunting.' You'll wonder why they bothered to make a re-make, proving that newer doesn't necessarily mean better."
"The tracks are great.The playing (might be) great.The recording quality is wretched.I hate to say that, but it is that bad."
"Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize, Pulitzer) and ""Travels With Charley"" is a wonderful book. It is not in this collection however. I find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary (read Dickens for instance). In comparison, E.B. White had a gracious side to his writing, a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the English language. I like them both but prefer White. I mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time. They were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight."
"It is not really my sort of movie, but it turned out to be a real winner. It is a story of a woman who wants to be famous at all costs. She ends out having her husband murdered and then... Overall it made me think.I thought it was well acted particularly by Kidman. The film was well filmed.Worth seeing."
"The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie ""Clueless"". However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person."
"I read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting. I read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is. The other thing I realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of Christianity. Big Brother. Thought crimes. Room 101. It fits perfectly. Of course, whether that was Orwell's intent I don't know (though he was an atheist), but I think the book is a masterpiece if analyzed in that way. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"
If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!
"What were they thinking when they put this collection together? Yes, it has almost - ALMOST - all of Elvis's greatest hits but where is ""One Night""? And why, why, why would they dare to include Elvis's horrendous live version of ""Polk Salad Annie"" and omit a classic like ""One Night""? It is for that glaring omission and that glaringly bad inclusion that I give this collection a rating of 4 rather than 5. Hey, I love Elvis Presley's music as much as anyone but he had no business recording ""Polk Salad Annie."" There's only one version of that song that should ever be heard and that's the original by the song's writer, Tony Joe White."
"I first heard ""Story of a Girl"" on VH1 and loved it. I bought the CD and was very pleased with the rest also. The whole CD is really well done and well put together. Buy it now."
"Judicious choice of tracks by Steve Howe makes a seemingly inessential purchase (how many best-of's/repackagings from the band in recent years?) hard to pass up. Disdaining the live tracks, solo meanderings (The Fish?), and subpar B-sides that afflicted Yesyears, this 6-hour package sounds and looks great. Nothing (incl. America) is abridged, and liner notes make a strong case for Yes rivaling King Crimson as musical pioneers. Packaging, as always with Rhino, is exemplary."
"I would strongly recommend this book to those who play ""Dungeons and Dragons."" I honestly don't care which of the 5000 races of little people someone belongs to. This book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book, but overall this book is dull, and Bilbo the main charachter complained most of the time.For instance, there was often a large gap between action scenes. I was really looking up to the death of Smaug, a charachter who's ego was expanded into godlike preportions, died a pitiful death, with hardly any contact with the adventuring gang. And finally, my favorite charachter(Gandalf)left prematurely."
"This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga, you don't need this at all - you can create and tailor your own workout. If you don't know yoga, it's useless. The instruction is poor, peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga (no wonder the surf mags think it's great!) with little, very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga. In some scenes you can't even see their feet (a crucial failure) - even if the ""instructor"" says what to do. Save your money, take yoga long enough to learn it properly, then apply it to your own surfing. Yoga is great for surfing, but this is a poor video."
"The software mentioned on my May 16th review IS called ""AVID Xpress"" -- not ""AVID Express"" -- when my review was edited someone changed the spelling, possibly thinking it was a typo/mistake?"
"I love these shoes and have owned many Chuck Taylor Converse shoes for 30 years. I did forget that when getting this shoe I must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size. This can be frustrating when ordering shoes online, so don't forget to order 1size down :)"
I taught myself how to crochet and this book answered the questions that I had. All the other books I have never explain certain things (like where to stick your hook in your chain row). It also contains alot of patturns I actually want to use rather than 1 or 2 in other books.
This film lost simple life of characters and sense of humor of basis of Anne's series.
"I originally was quite interested in seeing this film after reading a lot of good press about it. When I finally did see the film theatrically I mainly saw little more than the failed possibilities.In my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus. The two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down. As well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govWorks.com while other sections (most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital) are given a disproportionate share of the time. In the end I never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded. It could have been about any other business that failed with very little that was specific to the time, place, or culture that surrounded the Dot-Com Boom and why it went bust."
"Like many of the other reviewers, my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous ""Remove cassette"" message and is mangling tapes. I have used it to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years. Search the web for ""canon zr users group"" and ""eating tapes"" to hear similar horror stories. Stay away from Canon camcorders."
"This one makes me laugh everytime, if you've ever worked in a cubicle you will appreciate the humor and the office politics."
"I love all of Clifton Webb films, this one really extracts his serious side of acting. great film of the era, he is truly the one of the best actors of his time."
This book is a waste of money. It contains dated information and it is not well organized. You could find better data on Google.I was looking for a list of addresses for softball and volleyball players and there is no place in the book to find names that are grouped by sport.Save your money - take a few minutes and look up the information yourself. A real mess!
"Kids get to give an opinion of their favorite song and why. Encourages all children to have a voice. The songs and movement gets kids up and moving. My three month old granddaughter wiggles and kicks with the tunes, when she gets toddling she'll being dancing to it. The music, flashy colors and movement will keep any child entertained no matter what their age."
"Rawandi contends that reliable sources undermine the classical account of Islam and Sufism, and his study seeks to rectify this imbalance through studying the philosophy of religion and traditionalists to provide a new, critical analysis of Islam. Readers already well versed in Islamic religion and history will find this a scholarly, detailed probe."
"This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly, I sat down. I hated it. She fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end. Even that part was bad, and I didn't see all of it! I'd give it -10 stars for horrible scenes, cruelty to animals, and lack of trying. DON'T SEE IT EVER!!!"
This was my first read my Teresa Medeiros and it won't be my last. I enjoyed the character development - Gabriel was a great tortured hero. This one had a plot twist that totally surprised me.
"Nice book, not quite as good as I expected but had some really awesome photos! AC"
After 10 pages everybody could guess the end.I just hate predictable book the first part of this book is worth reading but if your not an hard core sci-fi fan drop it after.
"Pianist John Hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own. On this CD he is featured on a pair of solo numbers, a duet with flutist Elise Wood (a sensitive version of Duke Ellington's ""Star Crossed Lovers""), a trio rendition (with bassist Curtis Lundy and drummer Cecil Brooks III.) of ""Mood Swings,"" with a quintet (a blazing version of ""My Shining Hour"" that has both Bobby Watson and Vincent Herring on altos) and five selections with the full sextet. Four standards follow six obscurities (including Charles Mingus' ""Diane""). Hicks, who often shows off the influence of McCoy Tyner's voicings, has never recorded an uninspired record and this one is better than average for him. Due to the variety of moods, instrumental colors and settings, the music is continually interesting and well worth acquiring."
Gladitor is a must have in any movie collection. It is one of the few movies that is comparable to the likes of BRAVEHEART.
"10.You're a girl that has a crush on Vin Diesel 9.You're a kid that has no idea who James Bond is. 8.You're a serious movie goer looking for comedy relief. 7.You thought it was rated XXX. 6.You're a student from the USC film class ""Bad Movies 101"". 5. You had nothing better to do with your time and money. 4.You're a first-time moviegoer that was tricked by your 15-year-old sister. 3.You're a critic that's in hot water with his boss. 2.You believe that the WWF and WCW is a real sport. 1.That Vin Diesel guy is hot even if he can't act."
"If you want to discover a beautiful and wild French region through the eyes of a Scottish writer, read Travels with a donkey. Stevenson, before he became famous, depicted his journey in the cevennes, with his donkey ""Modestine"". Rediscover the excellent style of a young writer about to become world-wide-known."
"Biotutor is an invaluable tool for any student taking AP Biology or struggling in a Biology class. Last year I took regular Biology and did very well. I think my average was an A or A-. But, thinking I was such a good Biology student I took AP. It was not the same their is more math in it than I expected. But thankfully I found Biotutor and am now a great Bio student."
"I ordered the TiVo and it was shipped the next day (Friday). I received it in less than a week after I ordered it. When I got it, it was missing the remote. After contacting the seller, he ordered a new remote and had it sent to me as well as a ""how-to"" book just for the inconvenience that I encountered.Very good customer service, I would order again from this seller any time."
These really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me. The only problem I found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
"This book is based in fact, and done so very well. I have given it only four stars as the majority of the story, such as the dialogues and day-to-day happenings, is fiction. The young reader, such as my son, may very well take that book as all fact.The author has done a great job bringing the young reader into the adventures that Lewis and Clark experienced through the use of Seaman, the dog, Her use of historical reference such as the diaries kept my the Captains and other written accounts kept by the members of the Corps of Discovery reflect the importance and difficulties of the jouney. Seaman is the comic relief in the story and keeps the young reader interested and giggling. I learned a few things by reading this book myself.As a mother and historian, I recommend this book highly for the young reader."
"i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second, even though i missed it in the theaters. The day it was released on dvd, i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out. My roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite, was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated , summer popcorn flick.special effects were a plenty but def. less striking than the first one, the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of SPAWN. the story was kinda weak. But its a sequel i guess.Dont waste your time. rental only or wait for it on TNT."
"This movie was okay, it wasn't a 10 more like a 3..... I could have gone without buying this foolishness"
"Your impossible misson? Trying to watch this movie, and finding anything comprehensible about the plot. Tom Cruise said in an interview that it IS possible to follow the plot (but, obviously there is a problem if he has to point that out!). But does that mean one has to rewind certain sections five times, to get all the dialogue details? Movies are not like books. In theaters, you can't flip back five pages, to refresh in your mind who a certain character is. So things should be spelled out with CLARITY. Something this film is woefully lacking. Having said that, DePalma is a great stylist-director, and as a music video, this isn't a total loser. But as a movie, it is."
"The accuracy of this thermometer is really poor. I returned the thermometer for an exchange from Amazon. The replacement has same problem I did calibrate it, still it shows wrong temperature. I liked ease of mounting on the window and size, but completely useless as fas as what value it shows for the temperature."
"This book was not what I expected. The author spends much valuable time describing his personal trials and tribulations with the Russian ""system"" rather than explaining the what, how, where, and gory details of biological warfare. If you are looking for an exciting read, pass on this one...I did read the whole thing and I can guarantee it will put you to sleep every time you pick it up!"
"... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word ""ficbe"" came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me. Don't they have proof-readers anymore?By all means read the book--you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it--but not in this edition."
"I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear, in fact, after trying for a couple of weeks, I could not tell which one was the R and which was the L as they both fit so poorly. The spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearing.I threw these out and purchased the Umbo earbud. Much, much better fit there."
I love Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in this fun movie. The kids have an adventure living in a houseboat as opposed to living in an apartment in D.C.
"Albert Camus, born in Algeria in 1913, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and died three years later, but his writings live on. This collection of six unusual, strange-endinged stories will probably be of interest to a wide range of short story fans. Sometimes seemingly vague and symbolic (and with odd titles and endings), they are thoroughly enjoyable and readable. Though similar in complexity, subject matter and settings vary greatly: a woman joins her fabric-selling husband on a business trip, a detongued former missionary awaits his replacement, barrel makers strike, a prisoner is foisted on a schoolmaster, an artist works amidst ever-changing chaos, and an engineer visits inhabitants near the site of a future dam. Exile and the Kingdom is an excellent, strange, brief book. Other strange short stories: Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami."
"I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably, the digital copy code expired before this product was sold. At a minimum, this should have been disclosed in the product description."
Making Tivo apart of my wireless network was easy to do and now I can watch what is on either Tivo no matter which room I am in.
"I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded, good person. This book has nothing new in it. It is worthless. It is just another example of a poor deluded SOB trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering.This book is prosylazation. Prosylatizers, I have found, try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith, and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith. The truly faithful person does not prosylatize, for if one is secure in one's faith, why preach? If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE, I would."
"Excellent description of these two characters; Sarah is an alien, but she is also a woman who is desired and connected to O'Malley. Neither character realizes just what is happening to them at first during the landing of Sarah's spacecraft. While she is saved by O'Malley and his crew she has already defended herself on the spacecraft from some of her enemies.(Also aliens) She is very near death when it crashes in the mountains near the VLA (very large array)in New Mexico. Both Sarah and O'Malley have led very colorful lives before this encounter--and both want out of that past life. This is a book that has to be read when you have the time to just do it, cause it was hard for me to put it down."
"I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back, it is a truly great book. Like many of the enduring works of Science Fiction, its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into. Big Brother, The Two-Minutes Hate, Room 101 are all here. What's scary is how some of this seems to be coming true - but Big Brother isn't so much the government as it is Corporations. Just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays. Also, we watch the TV, but the TV also watches US. Advertisers, the Internet, and MTV control us more thoroughly than the Government could ever hope to espire to. Instead of telling us ""We are at war with East Asia. We have ALWAYS been at war with East Asia!"" they tell us what our values are, what music we listen to, what movies we watch, etc. ""We listen to Britney Spears! We have ALWAYS listened to Britney Spears."" Orwell would've been so proud."
"The Gadget by Paul Zindel is about a thirteen year old Stephen Orr. His Father is a scientist that works for the Goverment in the time period of the 1940's. If you are person who likes history and science this book is perfect. Stephen is a person who i can relate to becasue i know a person just like him. Matt Hadsell. They both like to explore the unknow and discover the undiceded. As my title says ""Too Good"" thats exactly what this book is, so if you like reading or just want an intersting read, the Gadget is right for you."
"For all of you that like English History with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella, THE DAUGHTER OF TIME by Josephine Tey. This is a mystery novel that deals a lot with English History and Old Kings and stuff, whic is something that I just don't mesh with. On a scale of one to ten I would have to rate this book a three. The reading was a bit hard, and I often found myself counting the pages until I was finished. Though I usually love mystery, this one was definitely a disappointment on countless levels. The book was written well and I think that if I had been a tad bit older and wiser on English History that I may have enjoyed it more. Overall I think that I would personally have to give the book two thumbs down."
"Susanna Baird enjoyed traveling with her writer grandfather, Robert Debenham, but their trip to Malta was an exception.First her grandfather fakes illness to stay free at the house of the Marquis Ramiro St Vincent, Susanna labeled him a Ogre.Then she found he had a son, Minu(Lorenzo)who was crippled by a badly crushed foot.Susanna found her label for his father wasn't bad enough when she discovered Minu could have the foot fixed, but his father didn't want his child seeing people outside his home.The child had no friends, except two dogs, and a monk.Susanna soon befriends the child, and his lonely heart is captured by her sweet nature.Soon Susanna finds she is falling in love with the ogre and he tells her he wants nothing to do with it her love.Later Ramiro tells Susanna that he is going to marry another woman, a woman he doesn't love, who doesn't love him.Minu over hears this, and runs away.Ramiro comes to his senses at last and they all live happily ever after."
"I am still a big fan of Grisham's earlier books, especially Pelican Brief, but I think he's run out of ideas. The Last Juror is tired, boring, derivative and a waste of time."
"Simply the best novek I have read. This not just a sci-fi novel. The world created by Herbert can only suit a envoirement in future. The story starts somehow complicated but soon you will discover the intelligence of the author. If you haven't read it yet, this must be first thing you have to read."
"I bought this along with the authors' grammar reference, which has proven an expensive mistake. The two are college level texts and probably quite good for those engaged in intellectual pursuits. I, on the other hand, teach ESL as a volunteer and was simply looking to shore up my practical knowledge of the subjects. Both texts contain virtually no such information. In fact, they assume a significant knowledge of linguistics and linguistic theory; they are literally packed with obscure jargon that I presume familiar to some set of initiates but certainly far beyond my ken. If your situation is analogous to mine, I suggest Side by Side Spanish & English Grammar and Practice Makes Perfect English Pronouns and Prepositions--much less expensive ($30 the pair I think) and much more practical."
"I do love ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"", a joy for the entire family, young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown, and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn't know the true spirit of Christmas, and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though.I like this toon because ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"" had the guts to tell about Gabriel telling the shepherds about the Good news that Baby Jesus was born in the manger. I would recommend this to all!"
"This is BY FAR, the best book I have EVER read! I HATE reading, and I read this 450 page book in three days! It was for summer reading for school, and I thought that I would read it before i saw the movie coming out soon! I AM SO GLAD I DID!! Thanks!"
"This back brush is what I have been looking for for a long time. others I have tried were too soft or were of sponge material that deteriorated quickly or fell off the handle. This one is a good, stiff, scrubbing brush that can get to all those places on my back that I cannot reach.I recommend this to anyone who wants to feel clean and scrubbed."
"The Last Unicorn is a TERRIBLE movie, for one the DVD release was very poor, and some aspects of the film weren't made for children...or ANYONE, for that matter. There isn't really a point to this film, so DO NOT BUY IT!"
"I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up."
A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
"As the teacher of a women's Bible class in a Lutheran church, I showed this movieLuther [VHS] after the class had completed six weeks of study on Dr. Martin Luther's life and influence on the Protestant Reformation. I would highly recommend this product because it stays true to historical facts and is not ""padded"" for today's audiences."
"I like every thing about my TiVo----except---- It is so busy running around the networks finding things to record. some thimes i want to record the end of a movie or program i'm watching and i have to go into the programing an stop it from recording it has found, before i can record what I want."
"Great movie, lots of fun. I rent it every year so I bought it. It's a light movie with a great cast. It reminds me of home."
"Disappointing. I haven't listened to this album since I bought it. Yes, I like Kiss, But this album just doesn't do anything for me. They should have recorded another ""Destroyer"", ""Rock And Roll Over"", etc, But this is not the case here. Save your money."
"Horrible can't describe this movie in a right light. This was the worse film I have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad Keanu Reeves is as an actor because he's at his worse in this film. He's so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over, that's how bad he is. The script is a huge mess and most of it does not make sense what so ever and the picture is way too dark in certain areas of the film. Rachel Weisz is great in the movie but she's basically carrying Keanu on her shoulders during most of the film while he over acts in horrific ways and she is stranded with a story that really should have had a good rewrite before it became a shooting script. Other than her, the movie is just a huge help of crap that should not have been made."
"We did not like this lube. It was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery. There are much better lubes out there for the money. It also stung per my wife, so we will not try this again."
"Poor quality product. Great idea - my daughter was super-excited to get this one, but flash light broke right away, binoculars are not strong at all, thermometer on the whistle does not reflect outside temp-re properly. Very disappointing purchase."
This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be. It even comes with a little storage case. Can't wait for my next splinter...
"Feinstein takes a different tack in The Open versus his previous golf books, A Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors. Instead of stories about the players on the tour, this story focuses on the people behind the transformation of the worn-out municipal golf course Bethpage Black into the great course that hosted the 2002 U.S. Open championship. I found I couldn't stop reading, as Feinstein's prose is once again funny, heartwarming, and flowing. My only critique is that I wished for more detail on Rees Jones' changes to A.G. Tillinghast's design, with illustrations. For a book about the transformation of the golf course, there isn't enough about the physical changes that were done. The book does a great job portraying the enormity of the project that was undertaken, so the satisfaction that is felt with the success of the championship seems to be well deserved."
"I ordered this item hopeful that it would fit my rods. However, as others have mentioned, the dimensions are not truly 2"" ... likely best for a 1"" rod. Anything over that just doesn't work.Regrettably, this item was returned."
This journal allows you to highlight the good things in your life. It makes you think of the positive rather than the negative. It is a must-have!
This movie is hilarious!!!!!!!! I saw it with my friend and we laughed throughout the entire thing.
"We've been getting Pampers Baby Dry from a Wholesale club for a while now, with no problems (my son is 13 months, in size 4). I saw the price on Amazon and with the 30% off, it was a great deal. However, when the box arrived the diapers smelled AWFUL -- chemical-like. I gave them a day to air out, which they did, but in the next few days of using them my son has developed a terrible diaper rash. He has only had tiny rashes 3-4 times in the past, but this one is continuous and awful-looking. We are discontinuing use of these particular ones immediately, and going back to the Wholesale club. I don't think it's Baby Dry, per se, but the shipment that Amazon has. It really upsets me that they would offer inferior diapers at such a reduced price -- they need to be tossed and NEVER touch a baby's skin."
His history and outline of the JDL ideology should be read by every Jew--whether or he or her agrees with Kahane.Read especially what he says about Jabotinsky.
"This book contains exactly one chapter on hydroponics and it's not a very good chapter. As a general book on growing, it's not bad, but anything that purports itself as being a ""grow bible"" should include extensive information on evaluating hydroponics systems and mediums and how to use and maintain them throughout a grow. This book contains some information on this, but not nearly enough. For whatever reasons, it includes far more information on genetics and breeding, but most growers I know buy clones or seeds. Those pages would have been better devoted to all things hydroponics.Is there a good book focused primarily on indoor hydroponic growing? Not sure I need it now, but it would have been great to have a few months back."
If you bought this you proably already like Elvis music. This cd is worth the money. Many of my favorite Elvis songs were in his movies and never released as singles or for that matter hits. This is a great way for me to hear them again.
"I was only 4 years old when I first saw the screen version of this book and then I was hooked. Granted I shouldn't have gotten interested in the book just because of the movie, but the movie went well with the book. It put a face to the all the characters that I was so fascinated with. DUNE should be a book that should be read in high school, and studied. There is a message for those who read the book and those who are die hard fans of Frank Herbert will understand and relate it to present day...."
"I'm sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on Clay's CD. I'm amazed that Clay even made it to the top ten on American Idol. I think that the only people that voted for him were people that thought he was ""cute"". Personally I think he is a disgrace to the North Carolina name. In conclusion, the only reason I give this CD one star is because you can't give a CD zero stars, if I could give it zero stars I would."
This product was just how I remembered it when I used it 30 years ago. Yes the answers are hard to see until you press down real hard. But that is how it was 30 years ago and I did not expect anything different. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to teach their kids addition and subtraction.My children look at it like a computer and love playing with it. It gives them instant answers when they press down and they like that satisfaction.
i thought this would be ok but i mean not a good title people say bad title but some said it was ok but not only is it bad but bad acting bad special efects and kids were pupkins on there head stupid stupid stupid and the death scenes kids shake there heads and die and a guy trieng to take over the world bad plot
"This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial, all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting David. David is the worst Night World hero[Thierry is the best]. He is stupid[he cheated on the SATs].If you haven't read any of the Night World books, don't start with this one."
"This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions."
"This CD contains nearly all of Peter Gabriel's through the album ""So"" in 1986. Go through the track list, and you will likely find more than a few you've heard on the radio. A glaring ommission is Gabriels' most famous (and possibly best) song ""In Your Eyes"". Although you will find that at least a quarter of the sixteen tracks on this CD come from ""So"", that song is missing from this collection. For that reason, I knock a point off this ""best of"" collection."
"The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to, say the least, with faded & washed-out images although the sound is OK. The grain is very high and contrary to another review, PAL TV in Australia in the 1950s & 60s did not look anything as bad as the images in this DVD. The other Youngsons that came out last year were better although the highest priced one did leave a lot to be desired in picture quality also but not like the Further Perils. If only Warner bros would buy more of these things for extras on their great DVD releases then we would have restoration similar to what they have provided on at least one L&H; DVD set. But to have this title in the collection gets us to more completion of the Youngson compilations on DVD."
"Since those responsible for this animated version of ""Animal Farm"" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954), this film is now freely available, for example on YouTube, where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety.It follows the book much more than the recent version did, although still very loosely. The biggest difference is its completely different, more hopeful ending."
Wonderful product at a great deal from Amazon.Babies will luv them.ALL stars. I am in for repeat orders for the Pampers diapers.
"This book is a pure pleasure reading for anyone interested in statistics, but wants to have a break from formulas and software! In fact, I would make it a must read for all citizens who are bombarded by over-complicated news about all areas of our life."
I have this toothpaste and the ADA seal of approval is nowhere to be found on the tube. It doesn't whiten either.
"Wow, what can I say? Totally ignorant, very very poorly done or just plain intentional lies to mislead people. Even those people who don't have any faith affiliations and atheists will find this book beyond poorly researched.I totally get it if one's own or other christian denomination's interpretation of the Bible is different from Roman Catholism and her teachings but when people (especially this book) intentionally MISREPRESENTS, fabricate lies that the other Church TRULY teaches, it borders bigotry and hatred which is against the 9th Commandment of God, ""Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor"".Please for humanity's sake.....read a lot of good historical books specially the other's side OFFICIAL teachings and not just from some disgruntled priest, nun or unverifiable source and lastly....be honest!"
"Gore yes, lots of information about autopsies and assorted other matters, rather too-clearly-fictitious characters ... It all adds up to a rather flat, dispiriting formula effort. If you just HAVE to know who's responsible every time you read of a fictitious killing, then you'll get through this, otherwise it becomes rather a drag."
"brilliant... brilliant! one of, if not THE, best movie ever made, by one of, if not THE best director who ever lived. the photography is amazing, and includes tecniques that were never before seen on the big screen - such as filming from the hero/subject's point of view. the sharp cuts and strong colors that are used empathize the intensity of the film, and kubrick is constently mocking the viewers by playing with their feeling concerning the main character - Alex - who is at first the vilain and at the end the innocent, helpless victim used and abused by society. the cinical message that the movie tries to pass on is cristal clear and relevant to the time when it was published. it is also a message very much empathized by the book - which is by the way terrible and written with the skill of my three-year-old brother. kubrick generally critisizes the development of a cold, rottong society that won't possibly survive for long. in conclusion, the movie it the work of a true genius."
"I went to see this but it was not by choice. I went on a ""field trip"" with my co-workers and this was the movie that won the vote.I am all for parodies (like ""Saturday Night Live"") but this movie went overboard. So does all the Scary Movies (I don't like these either). Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Get yourself a real ""Date Movie""."
"We bought this 2.5 years ago. It was very good at the beginning. However, just after 2.5 years of light use, it is now toasted. The rice comes out sticky and lumpy and drys up in less than 12 hours. We thought Zojirushi stands for quality and durability. We made a big mistake."
"This little gizmo works as promised. It's great if you want to transfer shows from one TV to another in your house. You can also download programs to your laptop providing you have TiVo to Go Plus. I'll never get stuck with another clunker of a movie on an airplane again.It took me a little time to figure out that in the ""setting up"" stage of connecting your adapter, you weren't supposed to enter the router's password but rather the complicated encryption key."
"This thing was easy to intall. I have a Dual 1.25 G4 Mac. No driver installations under Panther 10.3.3. If you're pre 10.2.X on a Mac you'll have to visit Iogear's website for USB 2.0 drivers. You shouldn't have any problems using this card with a G5 given the bus supports PCI cards either. Apple should just sell this card in their stores. This is my first Iogear product, and this is the best combo firewire/usb PCI card currently on the market."
"This hat is honestly one of the very cutest things I have bought for my daughter thus far. Everyone comments on it wherever we go and thankfully, there is plenty more room for her to grow into it!It's been machine washed and dryed several times with no problems. No fading, fraying, shrinking, or pilling.Super cute!"
I gave it all 5 stars just because my nephew loved it so much. He is very hard to please at 9 yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed. He likes hands on things and race cars so there you go.
I'm naturally a huge fan of Jeff Corwin and his work to help nature and its inhabitants is very much needed these days. He does a wonderful job in putting you in the locale that he is in. Vivid descriptions and his natural mix of humor makes this an excellent book for any reading enthusiast. Great photos included. Definetely worth adding to your collection. You'll have lots of fun reading it!
"I am helping my son with an electromagnetic induction science fair project and have studied extensively the requirements for these types of flashlights to operate. This flashlight is better than the 'fake' shake flashlight we'd previously ordered for $2.35 at amazon.com, because it actually uses a real NIB magnet and appropriate circuitry. However, the reed switch (which uses a small magnet to connect the capacitor's stored potential to the LED)doesn't work. Thus, the LED won't light. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. There are genuienly amazing shake flashlights that, both in function and design are truly brilliant devices, but they cost a lot more than this flashlight, so it seems that the old saying, ""you get what you pay for"", is proven true, once again."
"Oprah's book club has lost a lot of its credibility with this book.This book just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening.It babbled on for something like 360 pages to document the following things: A quasi-homosexual relationship between two mutes; A revolutionary drunk; A snotty, pretentious doctor who babbled on about Karl Marx (*yawn*-- how long is it going to be before people let him go?); A white trash girl who loved music.Save your money (and your time)."
"Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy."
So I don't really understand why this is considered a horror novel? I feel that it was made for children and Bradbury's writing style is a little confusing at times and kind of bland. I thought of it as more of an adventure story then anything. If you want something that is scary then this is not for you. I am a huge horror book nut but this book just didn't do it for me at all.
"Trust me, guys, this doesn't work unless you're a stud. It's all based on making ""eye contact"", and no girl is gonna be giving you 'eye contact"" unless you're an attractive stud. For the average joe, forget it, this just does not happen in real life."
I needed to replace my airbed but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.
I bought it as an extra book and have used the same book for years (mine was deteriorating) and have shown it to many friends to use when they express an interest in learning to play the banjo. It is a great book. I love it.
Zoo Tycoon is the best computer game i've ever had! It keeps me busy for hours and I never get bored. With expansion packs it's even more fun. I would suggest it for anyone who likes animals and is interested in zoos. You also learn about animals and what they like in their exhibits. The graphics are really good and the sounds are cool too. It's a little hard when you start out but it gets easier. It's the best game ever!
"Absolutely wonderful video, my preschoolers love it and now go around playing Bibleman the hero, They shout out ""Word Power"" to fight bad guy. This is a great improvement from playing slash and shoot them-up. The price was great."
my daughter and I love this movie. we have been watching it since she was a child she is now in her 20's and we still watch it together.
"Worked well at first, then a rubber band broke and I could not fix it, piece of junk!"
Me recordó aquellos libros de la Generación Kronen: un libro muy pop donde ha calado el lenguaje cinematográfico para presentar la trama. Personajes bien definidos. Un libro entre Yorkshire y la nostalgia del Levante español. Sorprendente y entretenido.
"Sure I only watched this because it was assigned for English, but I ended up liking it. Most other 15 year-olds don't like Shakespeare, but this is really good! I liked that they had the orignal Shakespearian language. I haven't seen the newer version of Romeo & Juliet, so I can't compare the two. I really recommend this movie to anyone. I sure would watch it again, even if it wasn't mandatory! It's an instant classic, and a must have for anyone. You wil love this movie. My parents love it too, it brings back a lot of memories for them (yes, good ones). All age groups would like this, except maybe ones younger than my age group (mid-teens). You won't regret getting (or at least renting it) so come on people, give this a try! Enjoy!!!!!"
"From the boy next door to every girls worst nightmare in a heart beat. A thriller that lets you love and hate the same character at the same time. Twists and turns keep your eyes glued to the television and Mark Walbergs gentle stare keeps you loving a psychotic. The ending keeps those who enjoyed the movie hoping for more. An ending scene with police divers keeps those who noticed it wondering, was he alive or was he dead? Just who's body were they looking for?"
"It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!"
This Biblical fiction is a great introduction to the story of King Hezekiah. The characters have depth and I am eager to read the next book in the series.
"I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture, you eat much less since it squeezes the he'll outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze."
"My book club is reading this book. A friend loved it and said it was a quick easy read. I hate it, hate it, hate it and have from the first few pages. The main character is boring, profane (for no apparent reason except lack of class) and whines about everything. The only thing I've enjoyed is the tiny bit about Austin, where I grew up. I adored Julia Child who was one of a kind. The author should be ashamed using her singular greatness to make money with this crass garbage."
"My kid is enjoying , Daiper takes lot more time than other ones and still will be fresh and dry"
it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
"People who have appreciated Real Music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the ""Measure of a Man"" CD. The crystal clearness, unspoiled beauty, perfect pitch, and power of Clay Aiken's voice is matched by the feeling he puts into every phrase. I am so impressed with this CD and, as much as I love each song, I'm blown away by ""Perfect Day""."
"This is the best book ever, as it explains many things and story's in the Lord of the rings book."
"I could play games and do word processing. If I had a problem I would reload my computer and start over. I'm retired with such outdated skills and physical disabilities that I was unemployable. Started school at NACC in Burbank,California went to class for ten weeks on weekends, read their texts and then bought A+ Certification before testing. I read it through twice, took both CompTIA core and dos adaptive exams the same morning and passed very comfortably.Without this book to put it together from start to finish I would have had to study longer and harder.My only suggestion is in making the Operating System Architecture section more simplified like it is in A+ Dos/Windows second edition Chapter 3 by David Groth."
"I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about 15 seconds. The video was made in 1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member."
"The edition of ""Jude the Obscure"" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback, with the two horses on the cover -- first came out in '61 and hasn't been touched since then (except to add a bibliography in 1980). There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published."
"I bought this tire for asphalt and cement roads, like it's name [ city ride ], but after using them for some monthsI noticed that if you have them with too much pressure the on bumps the bike can hit pretty hard and you can lose the control if you are not prepared; better to use low pressure.But the most problematic situation is the grip. I got into an emergency brake, a car show up in front of me, the driver was distracted, then the tire was completely stopped but slipping because it has zero grip because the center part which that is smooth is too wide.I am planning to create some groove to them just to using some more time.If you want your life don't buy this tire. I trust Continental but this was a failure. I can't imagine this tire in rainy conditions."
"This is one of the worst brochure design books I have ever seen. Outdated design and most of them from the United States.More like a marketing tool for Cheryl Dangel Cullen's designer friends.most of the designs dont even show the brochure covers.Another huge disappointment from Cheryl Dangel Cullen(same with Global graphics:colour and Global graphics: symbols, both of which are showcases of wrong information.)I wouldnt even give one star, but that is the bottom of the barrel!"
"This movie came out when I was 9 and it's been a fixture it my movie collection ever since. There are so many memorable moments, some filled with sheer hilarity, others that are quite touching. The acting is great, the story is good, and this is by far one of my all time favorite performances from Tom Hanks. In addition to the immortal line ""There's no crying in baseball!"", there is a large selection of quotable moments from many different characters. I'm not even a big baseball fan, but for some reason I've always loved baseball movies. Perhaps there is an innate fun and big-hearted nature to the sport when you use it as subject matter to frame a story. Films like this and Sandlot, and Field of Dreams, and Rookie of the Year have always had special places in my memory because of the fun and humor they inspired."
"This IS your bag:If you like action, fun, stunts, thrillIf you want to see something completely uniqueIf you are not afraid of timeblendsIf you like fabulous music from some of the hippest german people (that make look the far too streamlined usual scores look veeeery old)If you like cartoonsIf you like to rather sit and hold than to stop the vcr and go to toiletIf you like to experience sheer SPEEDSo, what are you waiting for? Run to get it!One funny sidenote: The movie's rating was for 12 years in germany. Americans are really funny with their prudery. It seems that the americans are as afraid of sex as the germans are of violence."
"The only thing interesting about this album is mia's accent. Seriously, the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clichéd. If the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top 500. Final Verdict: Bad music."
"An interesting book from both a literary and historical standpoint. A view into the lives and struggles of the first settlers of the Dakotas. A good read, particularly for those with an interest in America's Scandinavian immigrants."
"This has been my favorite book now for a couple of months, and I finally had to write a review that disagrees with the previous negative ones. There's no nice way to say this, but maybe there is a new money-old money difference in perception here. What I see in the book is one gorgeous and highly livable room after another. Lively, vibrant, personal and comfortable homes obviously used by real people. What I didn't expect was that I would pick up as many decorating ideas for my own home as I did."
The product came promptly and I like it. It was way cheaper than any of the big hardware chains and even one huge lumber and hardware store that caters to contractors. Item has good weight on it so it does not feel or look cheap. One thing I DID NOT like was that it was SMALLER than what the product description states. This is 1 inch in diameter NOT 1 1/4 inches. Other than that I am happy with it.
"I got this book because it had such awesome reviews. I'm going to be taking a test in the near future, and you're allowed to use a medical dictionary, and I picked this one.I've been taking practice tests. On the first practice test I took, the first 6 out of 7 medical terms I tried to look up weren't in the book. I was stunned, and several of them were pretty basic words that I just wanted to get a very clear definition of.I'm not sure it's even going to be worth lugging this book to the test, or even keeping the book. I may just sell it and try another book.Jane"
"Ít's one of the best books I've ever read. Was forced to read it for school so my expektations were the lowest ever... She's a very strong women and I like the way she gets what she wants. She's not afraid to make a sacrifice or two to have things her way, though I don't like the way she abandonnes her children all the time..."
We were trying to get winter of the world by Ken Follet. So when thats avialble I will order it corretly this time. Dave
"I was doing a research paper on the year 1984, and according to my teacher, NONE of this actually happened.I got a flippin' F.Last time I ever read a history book by this Orwell scrub.He doesn't know a thing about the 80s.Not ONCE did he mention Def Leppard or Karma Chameleon.I gave my copy to a donkey.He said it was about communism.Ass."
I really like this version; especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature.
"The bulb seems ok, the batteries have power, but the laser light does not work.The bulb came in 4days."
"For all the famous names in this movie, soomething better should have come out of it. It was predictable from the first, and the twists and turns were just silly. They couldn't leave the estate, although one of them managed to arrive from the outside. Just about every one was involved in something illicit, or at least in something strange. Lovers were talked about but not really discussed. The biggest bombshell involving supposed incest was discussed by just two of the eight and nothing was made of it. This movie was just an unrelated bunch of snippets that just doesn't work."
Short and sweet. Had it working flawlessly for 2 weeks now. No problems at all.
"In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says, ""Merrills are a hug for the feet."" Even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable. These go everywhere! I love them."
"It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her."
"This is no ""Mrs. Brown."" It is a fictitious assumption about Jane Austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak. Watch it once then forget that you did. It is harmless."
"Only reason to continue the series at this point would be to see how many more pages it takes for Ayla to invent The Wheel (and is anyone else as irritated as I am by the constant capitalized spellings for nearly every activity from ceremonies to having sex?) Seriously, I can guess why Auel is constantly rehashing material from earlier books--to hide the lack of a story or interesting new characters--and I had particularly looked forward to meeting Zelandoni, the previous great love of Jondalar's life. For an entertaining and far quicker read on the subject of Stone Age life, read Joan Wolf's trilogy(Daughter of the Red Deer, The Horsemasters, The Reindeer Hunters). I've recently reread the book, and while still giving only two stars, I must say that it reads faster the second time around--maybe because of knowing which segments to skip over altogether!"
"I bought this for myself, and upon using it just once the difference in my skin and hair was obvious. No itching or dryness! I promptly bought another for my mother- she is in her 80s and has said this has helped her skin and hair so much. We gave them as gifts to many people in 08, and every one of them has gone on to buy one to give as a gift to someone they love too. Honestly; easy to install, easy to use, instant results- great value for money!"
"The product is most likly good. But It when I try to install it to my computer, the class install manager denied my request to install it. This was very frustrating beacaues I have to return it. The Micro Innovations customer service was terrible, the people would lie over the phone just to get rid of you. The man said he would e-mail me the drivers I needed to install it to my computer with windows XP. But never sent them. Non of this is Amazons fault but I wish that they show weather its compatible with windows XP."
"How many graphically described violently mutilated corpses do they think it takes to sell a book? Having rather enjoyed Deja Dead (the genre of lady pathologists seems to be the flavour of the month), I just couldn't finish Death du Jour. I found it a rehash of the other with more blood and gore added and even some sex - wowee! It made me long for a good old romantic historical novel - where have they gone?"
"I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD ""Standing Room Only."" ""I'm So Glad"" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a ""must buy"" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco, Step would win for performer of the year."
"Passion Street is a cracking single from former Dr Hook vocalist Dennis Locorriere. The close harmony backing vocals & Dennis's spoken intro instantly remind you of the ""old band"" while retaining a fresh, crisp sound. Well wort checking out (as is the album)."
"I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first."
"This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, of Bag End, Under Hill, Hobbiton. The story tells of how Bilbo came to be involved in the dwarves mission to travel to The Lonely Mountain, defeat Smaug (the dragon) and retrieve their treasures and their homeland. It's a great tale of survival through untold hardships, when all seems to have failed, and yet, a little luck, and a little perseverance sees them through.The Hobbit is a great introduction into Tolkein's world and a great set up for the Lord Of The Rings. I highly recommend it."
The only thin I had trouble with us the language and vocabulary. Other than that it's a very good Christmas story
"I bought these last year and tried them on - too small, but I thought perhaps they'd stretch out a bit. WRONG! I've been wearing them now - still almost new - for a month now w/ no luck on any stretching. My toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt! I even have a narrow foot, for what it's worth - not that the width would affect much. Still - bummer.."
I really love this book just as much as the two before it. I just don't want the series to end because I'm enjoying it so much.
"I thought this was a great book - especially for someone just learning about this like me. The writing is easy to get into (in some cases a bit too cutsy I'm afraid but I looked past that). I enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction. The section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween (black cats, witch hats etc). There are some fun divinations which include runes. And there are of course blessings and recipes etc. I think this would be a great family book - to give kids (all of us really) a bit more meaning to the day rather than just getting a stash of candy from the neighbors. Definitely a great introduction and fun stuff to do. I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 since I was expecting a bit more substance but its fun nonetheless."
"When I started reading the book at school I found it boring. I had to read it for school (if I didn't read it I would had a 1) and almost all the class found it boring. It's funny when Leenie (principal characters who does stupid thing. George say's in one part to the owner of the ranch ""I'm not saying he's bright, he ain't, but he's as strong as a bull."") but the theme doesn't make it a pleasure to read. The book is easy to understand and doesn't have difficult words. The story is about to people, George and Leenie, who are itinerant workers who go to one place to another to find job. They have a dream but it's very difficult for them to make it true because of Leenie's dumbness. When they're working in ranch problems happens because of Leenie. The entire story is about that subject. To finish my review ill tell you not to spend your time reading this book when there are better books (unless you have to read it for school). I could only recommended to Steinbecks fans."
The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.
I ordered this for my daughter because she lost her other 'Scat' beanie baby. It is a very durable toy. The order came quickly in the mail and in very good shape.
"This sequel to Chinatown must be one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. It is badly written, badly directed (by star Jack Nicholson), and contains bland performances by two of my favorite actors, Nicholson and Harvey Keitel.Spare yourself the agony of wasting 99 cents on renting this turkey and rent the masterpiece Chinatown instead."
"I own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier CD release. I am always a sucker for a remaster, so decided what the heck. I chose poorly - the remixes just don't sound right. For all I know, this 2006 version was the original intent, I hope not."
"Whether you are a beginning writer or an established author, this book gives solid advice. I love how you can read the book from cover to cover or just flip to a section that you want to know about right now. Keep it handy and reference it often.Karen Reddick, author of Grammar Done Right!"
esta pelicula es una de las mejores que e visto alex se luce dando una clase de road movie con gore al por mayor esta pelicula no es apta para personas sensibles esta al nivel de asesinos por naturaleza de oliver stone
"Sincerely, I didn't expect a surprise like this. I went to the theater expecting to see a typical entertaining film -I see all the Kevin Spacey's-. When I got out I had that taste in my mouth that only leave the really good films.Magnificent interpretations, a solid script, a good direction and -in occasions- a splendid BGM is all you'll encounter in this film. I won't miss it.Or, at least, that's my opinion..."
"Expensive and works for less than 3 years, at which time it will flood your kitchen. I've had two dispensers and both flooded the kitchen. How this product stays on the market is beyond me."
"James Herriot's Dog Stories is written by a man who loves both people and animals. The descriptions of people, dogs, and his humble view of himself are an irresistable combination. The accuracy and wit with which he presents people's relationships with their dogs is priceless. When I read this book, I laugh at the eternal goofiness of dogs and also dog people! The sadder stories are written with a balanced view. This book is an amazing collection of short stories. Highly recommended."
"I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure, back then there was no Google searching nor number crunching laptops. But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book's greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today's analytical resources, economists are still all over the map on their predictions & conclusions. On the other hand, meteorologists seem to do quite well.Naturally the radical libertarians, tea-baggers & Republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence. I would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty & irrational."
"This 1988 version of The Blob is fantastic. I Love this movie so much, words cannot describe. Shawnee Smith, Kevin Dillion, Donovan Leitch, erika eleniak, candy clarke and the always georgeou Ricky Paull Goldin are all perfectly cast in their roles. The effects are great. I adore the music. Chuck Russell made the best movie. One of the best movies around."
"This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly, the march has plenty of swagger, the polkas mazur have poise, and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats. Josef Strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key, but there are none of them here. What is here is his last composition, the “Hesperus-Bahnen Waltz”, published as Op 279, after the forty-three year old composer’s death."
"The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins, right? Unfortunately, the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies. At least Van Damme didn't do the splits in this movie. Then again, that might have given the film a memorable momement."
"When my son wheres Pampers, the poop always rides up his back. I am very disappointed in these diapers and can't believe all the positive reviews. I gave it 2 stars because it does hold in pee alright for 3-4 hours max. These diapers don't perform as well as Huggies Snug & Dry."
"I have wanted to see this musical for the last year, and was overjoyed when I heard that 'Great Performances' would be showing it on April 5th. After a gruling two weeks, the big day came. I watched with unblinking eyes trough the entire show. I thought it was one of the greatest shows I have ever seen on 'Great Performances', apart from 'Cats' of course. If I could give it higher then 5 stars, I would. Though the Mrs. Potiphar's scene I have to admit was a little on the personal side, it didn't really show anything. Her servents costumes were NOT see through, they were just white mesh with extremly small holes between the fabric thread. I would recomond this to anyone that wants to watch and listen to a really upbeat musical that you just have to get up and dance to. If I could find it on video around my town and if I had the money to buy it, I would."
"Los Mocosos is a very unique band with strong latin roots from the Mission Dist. If you are a fan of Santana, Malo, War, Tower of Power this is a must CD for you to have in your collection. I have all Los Mocosos cd's and they are all great. This one includes an eclectic mix and a beautiful remake of ""I'm your puppet"". It is better than the original. These guys will go far and I hope they stay together for a long time to come. It is not very often that I like a whole CD but I like every song on this Cd. This is a cd that you must get. Check out their other cd Shades of Brown also a great cd. Peace Light Love Joy and enjoy this Los Mocosos cd. Ike"
"The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind. You may read it to understand how the bigot's mind actually works."
"I purchased this a few years ago and found it extremely useful. Now I cannot find the original and am ordering another copy. I found it practical, useful, correct, the right size, etc. and would recommend it to anyone who is serious about opera."
"I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well, after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth. Not too much fun there. I feel I wasted my money."
"Like many others, I struggled for MONTHS with an inconveniently located wart on my finger. I tried three (3) other kinds of retail removal products, and I was thinking that perhaps I was just out of luck. Then, I read through the reviews for this PediFix Wart STICK and was encouraged enough to try one more time. The product arrived quickly, AND MY WART FRIEND IS ALMOST GONE! Excellent."
This movie would make a great opera adaptation. Dare I say Sara Miles carries the movie more than the David Lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy-handed score?
"This 1999 horror film based on the original ""The Haunting"", is creepy in some ways, but altogether, it's not really a great film at all. It has good acting, and the scares and pop-outs are clever (things that boost my rating from a 1 to a 2), with an ending that isn't perfect, but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart. The film moves slow in the beginning, and it starts to pick the pace soon after, and later has it's intense ending. The film is OK in some ways, but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win, but it still isn't horrible. I liked the house and the setting, though. That was cool. The complete storyline was pretty good, also. If you want some innovative horror from 1999, I suggest you get ""The Blair Witch Project""."
"Being a 31-year old male, I am probably not the typical Clay Aiken fan. As with many, the first time I heard the album I was disappointed...very disappointed. After I listened to it a couple more times it started to grow on me. Now, I think its actually very well done, and Clay's vocals on the album are absolutely incredible.For those who were unimpressed with the album, I encourage you to listen to it again...maybe even twice. If you still don't like it, fine - shelf it...but I think you'll find it will grow on you.It seems a lot of people had a similar experience....the more they listened, the more they liked it. I have also noticed that reviews written within the first few days after the release have been much more negative than those written a week or two later.So....listen to it again!"
"This movie was 100% perfect, except Faye Dunaway should have caked some make-up on and played Joan of Arc herself. She has limitless talents and would have brought the movie what is was missing--a truly spiritual heroine. I'm telling you, Faye Dunaway was born to play this part. One can only hope of a re-make, and soon!"
"We tried Pampers Baby Dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day! Our one year old baby is a size 3 and doesn't have any problems in swaddlers, cruisers or other store brand diapers. I couldn't believe how leaky these were!"
Eragon is a total joke. I'm like the only one I know who finished it. Most of my friends tossed theirs. Does any character do anything it makes sense on it? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
"I have tried this item a few times and learned:The strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker, nor is there anything in the design of the cooker part to permit the strainer top to attach to it. This means that when you tip the cooker over to pour out the water, the top falls off! Danger of scalding and steam burns!It worked adequately for rice vermicelli, which one would normally just soak in boiling water anyway. When I tried it with penne, the pasta pieces on the bottom of the container didn't even get wet from the hot water, never mind cooked! I still had to remove the pasta at the end of the so-called cooking time, and transfer it to a pot of boiling water in order to get it cooked!This so-called pasta cooker is a waste of time. Not a waste of money if you want to have a plastic vase for long-stemmed flowers... that's what you can safely use it for!"

"I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately., I was disappointed. The movie while poignant, was spasmodic and disjointed. I had to try too hard to piece together the events while they were occurring. James Caviezel's performance was compelling. Dennis Quaid's acting was fair."
"I'm giving it one star because less isn't possible here.You people _do_ realize that this book and all others of its kind are complete and utter fiction, right? There is and can be no truth behind them whatsoever: no science, no documentary or physical evidence, nothing! There are no MIBs (except in the movies), no secret ""conspiracies"" to hide evidence of alien visitations, no alien abductions,... absolutely none of this book or any of its kind are true.Ask yourselves: If this is really true, then why, with our government so unable to keep secrets about presidential peccadillos, financial scandals, politcal dirty tricks, payoffs, espionage and intelligence screwups and the like, how any ""conspiracy"" of this magnitude escaped detection and revelation?It simply makes no sense. It is pure entertainment, nothing more.And you Five-Star reviewers have credit cards....?"
"I found the book itself to be interesting and entertaining, however I attempted to write a paper about it for school, but there is no publisher information or translator. I do not suggest this version of the book for students planning to use it in papers."
"The Zumo works great. It's well built, water proof and easy to use. I was able to down load a route like I wanted and it followed it to a tee (you have to set it to ""Off Road"" mode). The fuel gage is nice to have it gives you a heads up before the low fuel light comes on. I wish it would show the speed limit like my Nuvi does. I would recommend it and I would buy another one."
"This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with ""Into Thin Air"" or ""The Climb"". Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is."
"The lLord of the Flies is a great book. It is a book that should be used in every school, because is shows a great struggle for survival on a deserted island with basicly nothing."
"After buying this CD for its hype, I became an instant Lauryn Hill fan. All songs on the CD were fantastic. Some better than others, but all good. My favorites are ""to Zion"", ""Ex-Factor"", & ""Forgive them Father"". If you like hip hop you will love this CD!"
"I heard this group on the radio and had to have their cd, which I like very much. My only disappointment is that my favorite track, Sinklars vise, is incomplete. The singer is cut off midsentence and it was a longer song on the radio. Even though I can't understand the words, the rhythms are mesmerizing."
"Lyrics are very relavent to these days and times that we live in. Music is awesome, vocals are still hot!"
"I agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend MOST of your belief in reality. I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod, but it COULD be shot from the hip. He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!"
"This item is very overpriced. I ordered it because I wanted the very best, and I thought I would get what I paid for, but it is no different than other pans a half the price. Also, the information sheet that accompanied the pan had so many restrictions and warranty cop-outs that if followed would make the pan almost unusable."
"I've had this product for at least six years. I love the functionality. We receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle. But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great. We have a vacation home so I add the county number for that location when we are there. Most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we don't receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky.I originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface. I'm a techie and I can pick up an object I have not touched in a while and operate it. However, I always forget how to add a county number and it takes me a few minutes to figure it out. Maybe they have already improved it since mine is so old."
"This CD is one of very few that I own that I listen to the entire CD. I enjoy each song on the album, and I find myself constantly singing along. I highly recommend this CD."
I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
"My son is only 6'2 and if he wishes to be an NFL QB, well then, mutation is the best possible avenue now that human growth hormone is banned. I put this stuff on his cereal in the AM and now after a month he stands at 8'1. Can you say signing bonus?"
"Got these bits a couple of weeks ago to replace a 20+ year old Craftsman set. The first thing I noticed was the heft of the assortment; same number of bits as the Craftsman, but considerably heavier. Have mainly used a couple of the larger ones on a cast iron grill; they chewed through like it was pine. Have used some of the smaller bits to drill out rusted bolts. You only need to watch the metal filings pile up to know they're doing their job. Haven't used any on wood; seems like overkill and my older ones do fine for those. I only wish the storage box had a more positive lock mechanism. But I do like its bright size markings (sure beats stamped metal, which I can never read in weak light). All in all, I'm very pleased, and the price was GREAT!."
"As far as I know,this predates anything else known as ""drone"" music,which seems to be a popular genre these days.This is about as psychedelic as it gets,your mind wandering out into the infinite void.So good."
"Perhaps I was expecting too much, given the long wait since book four, and considering that I thoroughly enjoyed the other four books in the series. However, this book for me was nothing but a brain dulling barrage of introductions and recaps of the other books in the series. In fact, I must admit that I did not finish reading this book. After 200 pages of pure ""nothing,"" I finally decided to discard it. I had help with this decision, though. A good friend of mine began listening to the book on tapes at the same time I began reading. She finished--only because she has a long commute and nothing better to do--and quickly informed me that absolutely ""nothing"" happens, that there is no drama, action, or any form of brain teasing within the pages of this new book from Jean Auel."
"I purchased this book at the Duke University bookstore, after the recommendation from a professor at another institution.Petroski's prose is extremely dense and verbose. His style consists of run-on sentences which require several readings. Even if it is technically (grammatically) correct, it is extremely difficult to read. The subject matter is dry to begin with, however, Petroski does nothing to liven it. I am an engineer also, and am not threatened by the technical information (admittedly lifted from his students' term papers). I have chemical engineering textbooks that read like a novel. Hopefully the courses he teaches are clearer than this muddled prose.Petroski is certainly an engineer. He has engineered an elegant method of making money from saps like us. I successfully engineered Petroski's book into a beverage coaster to help drown the sorrows of wasting $14 on this book."
"I saw this movie on TBN channel last night and it was good. To the previous reviewer and anyone who is interested, you can get this movie in DVD format from World Wide Pictures homepage (http://shop.wwp.org). I'm going to order one from there today."
"in this book, buyan writes about average everyday things of the 1700s, and about the christian plight of that time. i found it remarkable how truth does not change '.'"
"This performance is one of my favorites in a large collection of dance videos. Not only for the dancers and choreography, but the music, too."
"this is truly the most compelling book on commercial office space that i have read, and i have read all of them. It is short,concsice and to the point.Tunis captures the essence of what it means to negotiate for a piece of space and delivers it in a way that the layman can understand even the more complex points. A one of a kind book that i would heartily recommend for anybody looking to get in the commercial real estate field or just searching for office space."
"I tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin reaction. The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro. Don't believe me.......read the other ""reviews"" they have left. Buyer beware....any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written."
"would like to know where you got that info on lauryn hill saying she'd rather her kid starve than let her cd get in hands of a white person... i am a 'white' woman and am considering buying this... cuz i like her values and morals that i heard her sing of when a friend played 'to zion' for me. i am a christian and i rarely listen to secular stuff, but consider buying this...but not if she hates 'white people'. would like to know the source of your info, lem."
I read Cheaper by the Dozen more than 20 years ago in Thai edition. And I bought it to all of my friend for presents. This is a book you must have in your house. Now I am about to buy the original/English version. I still read it every time I found it at the bookstore. I love this book.
I am/was your classic doormat kind of girl and I realized that I just might be doing something wrong. One day I was discussing this with my friends and she recommended this book. In the first 10 pages I learned what exactly I was doing wrong. I recommend this book for every woman who feels like she needs to change herself for the better and no longer wants to be a doormat.
"No surprises left, and a highly predictable plot. But great action scenes and spectacular special effects. Tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode, but lacks the suspense and drama. My 8 years olds got a kick out of it. I got bored."
"If you want to spend a fun evening with someone, watchingthis DVD is the perfect way to do it. It had us both institches. Bill Engvall is funny, funny, funny and doesn'thave to use foul words to do it."
Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
WARNING....be careful of buying this unless you have a HD DVD. Too bad I bought this DVD as none of my players can view it and can not return it.
I had this VHS tape years ago but no longer own it. I'm looking for the DVD version of it because it is one of the most enjoyable work-outs tapes I've ever done...and I've done a lot of them.
"They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me."
"Don't get confused here, this isn't a swaddler style diaper. There is NO, I repeat... NO wetness strip. This diaper came up when we searched for swaddler and its our mistake for not reading closer. The diaper is a bit small in size compared to the swaddler ones and the lack of wetness strip makes it an easy 2nd place choice to the same size Pamper Swaddler."
This product came with 2 pieces that are warped - so the oven door closes too far and the fridge door won't close all the way. The stove / sink top piece is split and the screw holes for the faucet were drilled too small.I would not recommend.
I've been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables. Here's an attempt.A tortoise falls fromthe sky. Brutha must showthe heretics Truth.
"""Infamous Scribblers"" was a fantastic read. Newspapers haven't changed much since colonial times. the best part of the book was the historical facts brought up, and the infighting of politicians and printers, among themselves and with each other. It brought out things about our founding fathers that aren't in your regular history books. There is a very great likeness of events and people then and now, The one big difference today is newspapers don't attack like they did then. They didn't hold back much at all and would keep it up and not backdown. Give it a try I think you will enjoy it....Ken"
"this is one of those movies that after you have watched it you go back and watch it again to see the clues to the ending and plot twist that you missed. i rented from the ""redbox"" for a buck so i was out nothing if it sucked. but it was a great movie so i bought it in blue ray. remember bruce willis in the sixth sense? it is much like passengers. i don't want to ruin it for you. just buy it, you will love it."
"The composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the 19th century. Their attempt was to create an ""American music"" from native American sources of rhythm and tonality. I get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as I got the first time I heard Erik Satie. The songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh. Don't expect much in the way of tom-toms and movie indian harmonies. I love to find songs that go to unexpected places. I found that here.For a much more sophisticated review, search ""American Indianists"" and Fred Flaxman."
"I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn't make much of an impression on me. I can't remember why. But knowing the fault could've been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it's famous, right?Well, folks, it's famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters? Is it more than just an oh-so-correct theme dressed up as a novel? Oh, yes it is! It's absolutely fantastic and I just plain can't recommend it enough.If you love sci-fi, great. If not, it doesn't matter. I can say ""transcends the genre"" with a straight face. Yes I can. I'll be reading this one again, folks. I didn't write it and I'm just sick with jealousy about it, okay?"
This book covers almost every aspect of Exchange that you will need to pass. It also has study questions that are almost identical to the ones that you will encounter on the test. The CBT that comes with the book is useless though.
"Clay Aiken does it again!! From the first time I heard Clay sing, I was a fan. I voted for him when he was on American Idol (a lot more then once, let me tell you) and now I am even obsessed with him. I was so excited when Clay's album came out. I love each song on the album and listen to every one evey day almost. There have been a lot of bad reviews and I am not going to get mad because that is their own oppinion. But, I really don't know what they are talking about. Maybe they are listening to a different CD or something, because this album is amazing. His voice could have been showed off more, but on a couple of songs it really is showed off like in Perfect Day. I think a lot of people would love this CD!"
"Love the book..I was born 250 years too late..I would have liked to been there at the time...HOWEVER, massacre does not sound like it feels good ! lol"
"For all those who have been, are, or are going to embark on a spiritual shopping spree, Mick Browns ""A Spiritual Tourist"" is a delicious rendering of one journalists journey. He remains scheptical and distanced from his subject matter throughout. Though on the odd occasion he cannot help but get involved and be affected by the people he meets. From the appearence of ""verbati"" in London, to joining the throngs that sit at the feet of Si Baba, (though I did find this chapter long winded) to a meeting with the Dali Lama and the Theosophical society, to crosses appearing on the windows of a church in the United States and his final chapter, which I perticularly enjoyed, being a visit to a Buddist centre in England, his journey is informative, honest and inspiring. I thouroughly enjoyed every minuite and found many of his conclusions enlightening."
"I gave it one star because the website doesn't allow it to go any lower, and, for all the effort put in by the computer animation team. Other than that, this movie should be negative 1 star.The plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever. To list a few; teleporting another planet into earth's atmosphere? Really? Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie? High tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields, swords, and axes?There's literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every 5minutes of the movie, throughout the ENTIRE thing. If you thought the second movie was ridiculous, wait until you see this.The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for 2hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things. Besides that, please do yourself a favor and do something more productive with the extra 2 hours of your life."
"The original was a sexy and track performed by a half decent R&B; group. RL and Next could really hit it off any make people want to dance. It was a good track in 98 and I think would be Next's biggest track.And theres this - a fake ass attempt from some pretty british boys to become an R&B; group. Blues version of this song is nothing but an attempt by the record company to cash in on others material and success.They dont add anything to the song, making it sound almost identical to the original. Even the backing track sounds almost the same as the original.I completely dislike this version of the song and I passionately dislike this group and everything they come out with. And yes, Iam very biased in my opinion here :)Blue - Stick to what you good at - singing at the pub or at the kareoke bars."
"With the words 'natural foods' heading the title, I expected to find whole foods, vegetarian dishes, and low fat recipes. I did not. This cook book is exactly like every mainstream American cookbook I have encountered, it is full of meat recipes. Only 12 recipes made it into the vegetable section. In addition, there are ingredients called for such as 'canned mushrooms', 'packaged onion soup mix' and 'undiluted cream of mushroom soup'. One sauce recipe for a meat dish, called for a half pound of butter! I am not what I consider to be a health nut, but this book fell far short of my expectations.I could not find a publication date, so I am assuming that this book was written before there was clear health information on eating whole, low fat, foods."
"This is a damm good swing cd. Don't listen to the other reviews saying that its Ska. There are only traces of Ska in tracks such as Dr Bones, and Pink Elephant. The band is excellent but they do have a habit of adding extra horns and a piano player don't get me wrong these sound great but it makes me wonder if they would sound as good live. As for the lyrics some may find them offensive but in that case don't buy the cd. My opinion? I thought that the lyrics fitted in well with the songs and the style of music. If you like Neo Swing and bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Royal Crown Revue then this cd is defiantly for you."
"At the time of this writing, when I click on 'See all 91 reviews' ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS on the page (reviews 1-10) are written by a reviewer who has reviewed ONLY THIS BOOK! Since 7 of these 10 reviews ARE 5 star reviews I either have to conclude that this book is the most sensational book of the century and inspires people who have never written another review ever to sign up on Amazon to do just that for this book OR the ballot box is being stuffed here. Read the more measured reviews and the astute reader will be able to easily discern which of these two possibilities is true...I, personally, don't like it when the seller himself or reviewers associated with the seller do not identify themselves as such when reviewing a product!"
"After ordering these eargels, I spent an enormous amount of time trying to make them fit. It was useless. Unless you have elephant ears, or you wish to grease them and use a hammer to insert them, they won't work."
"I have had Dickies pants/shorts on and off since high school. I used to skateboard much more than I do now, and find that these are quite durable. The regular 874 pants have the best fit out of all the other selections available. The only thing I don't like is they attract lint a little too much."
Great movie! Stanley Kubrick is personaly my favorite director after watching this movie. After I read the book I went out and bought the movie without seeing it. I think that the movie is as good as the book. The only downside to the whole movie is it did not add the additional chapter like in the book. But even the ending to the movie is great! Kubrick really scored big in this movie. Back then to make a movie as hard core as this one was crazy but he did it. This movie is so ahead of it's time. But it's my favorite movie of all time!
"I pack and ship items on a daily basis. I bought this tape to seal my packages. It was cheap (so yay for price), but extremely low quality. It will not adequately seal a cardboard mailer without many layers. Even then, I worry that the package will open in transit.Lesson learned. Next time I will pay more for a higher quality product."
Well!We never had any issues with pampers brand of diapers.We've tried all other brands (Cheaper & expensive ones) and nothing comes close to diapers.
"Stupid piece of trash that is the black sheep of the ""Halloween"" franchise, because, it has nothing to do with the Michael Myers saga.After the death of a toyseller, a doctor and the toyseller's daughter investigate his mysterious death. There snooping leads to the Silver Shamrock mask making company and to it's owner - a warlock bent on destroying the planet by way of his magical melting masks, that children wear on Halloween, turning them into slimy snakes, bugs and venomous insects.""Universal Pictures"" bought the rights to this turd, along with ""Halloween II"", hoping to take the franchise into a different ""Twilight Zone"" style direction, with a new ""Halloween"" film supposedly coming out every season. Instead the studio put the series right into the toilet. John Carpenter wrote the music and serves as executive producer (with Debra Hill) and Nick Castle (""The Shape"" from the original) directs this piece of celluloid waste. Stick with the original."
"Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation, I'm in the generation that got the bill. This book glossed over most everything. If anything it proved the opposite of its title."
"When I started working in office (and a cubicle), all of my friends told me that I had to watch ""Office Space"" because it is so much like work and it's hilarious. Finally, I did get a chance to watch it... but I ended up being quite diappointed. Yes, there are some funny parts to the movie, but I was more disgusted with some of the supposed ""humor."" It could be that I tend to like movies that have some value or even a plot (even if it didn't have either, some HUMOR could have been good). I could have done without this movie, but at least now my friends will quit bugging me to watch it.Word of advice: I wouldn't watch it with kids or with older parents. Actually, I wouldn't watch it at all."
"this game is hard and I still havn't beaten it, and I have had it for two mothes. I reconmend for only skilled players play.DELTA 904thanks for youre time and patience"
"I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material, but this book was great. It was a quick read, which once I started, I couldn't put it down. Everytime I got my eyes dried and cheered up, bam- he hit me with something new and I was crying again. Patterson has outdone himself yet again."
I ordered the Boston pencil sharpener and was sent the x-acto sharpener. I do not like it. My round pencils get stuck. The opening is not quite big enough. It is very noisy and it does not sharpen evenly. I sharpened three pencils and will return it. Very disapointing to get a different product than ordered.
"That was how English novelist Evelyn Waugh descibed Joyce when he came to write FW, and the judgment is apt. The book itself is tripe; but the contortions Joyce fans put themselves through to justify it are always a source of amusement."
"If you have a child that is late with speech development, seems frustrated with communications, strong willed & defiant, prone to tantrums, good at solving puzzles, loving but sometimes aloof, concentrates on some tasks, ignores requests to perform other tasks, not the least interested in potty training, exhibiting some autistic or PDD tendancies but having exceptional memory and suprising intelligence, then you need to get this book. Don't be put off by reviews of the professionals, the book has some information that will help concerned parents bypass those professional egos and cut to the main issue, how to best understand and help your child."
"It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it."
movie was awsome they did bring back general oneill wich i am REALLY HAPPY about that my only problem with the movie was richerd dean andersons character wasent showed enough
"I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!"
"I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer. She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages, I put the book down, finally admitting to myself that I really didn't care what Ms. Powell thought or opined about anything. I was finding her blog-turned-book to be just one more rant from a neurotic New Yorker, a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago. It was never that high to begin with.Unfortunately, a friend had given me the book, thinking I'd enjoy it because of my fondness for Julia Child. Maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author. Juxtaposing herself with Julia Child invites one to think about issues of character, style and substance. On all those measures, Ms. Powell suffers.My recommendation: see the movie, but forget the book."
"I recently bought two pair of these noise cancelling headphones to replace earlier headphones we had bought from Radio Shack. We wanted to upgrade quality while not going through the roof in price. I did a fair amount of online research and decided to buy the well regarded PXC 300s and am not disappointed at all. My wife and I use these for traveling. We travel overseas and try to be pretty light, so the ability to fold up and become quite compact was a strong plus. Comfortable to wear - not too much pressure on the head. Good noise suppression. I'm sure that we would get better fidelity (and bulk) with Bose, but at barely $100 per pair these are an excellent choice."
"I saw Mission Impossible I when it first came out in theaters, and did not watch it again until I bought this double disk set. I enjoyed it just as much if not more than it's incredible sequel. Both movies together, even though they are very loosely related, add up to a great buy."
"Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's."
"My 7 yr old son became interested in the Hobbit after a Lego catelog showed up with Lord of the Rings and Hobbit themed lego sets. He tried to read my copies of the LOTR and the Hobbit, but it was a little to much for him. I was excited to find a graphic novel version of the Hobbit. The pictures are engaging and keep to the spirit of the story. I know it misses some details that you will only get from reading the originals, if he loves the story as much as I do then he will eventually read the full length novels when he is older."
"I cannot seem to get over the fact that Russel Crowe won an Oscar for this! He swung a sword around for 2 hours, come on! If you want to see the Best Actor of 2000, i'll refer you to Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls). Crowe's character reached no emotional level whatsoever. We saw his wife & kid through 40 seconds of silent flashbacks, tell me why we should sympathize with his grieving?? Well photographed, well choreographed, but the rest--Craptacular."
"If you've always wondered why the grandmother in Flowers in the Attic was so mean, this book is for you. This is Olivia Foxworth's story of how it all began. A great novel, one of my favorties!"
"I read this book in one day and enjoyed every minute of it. It has the classic ""Beauty and The Beast"" theme which happens to be a favorite of mine. Samantha was a spunky heroine who's quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient. Gabriel was a hero to be adored. Unlike most ""wounded"" heroes who choose to sulk and mope about - Gabriel's defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper. He was a complete ass and I simply adored him!I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two.Highly Recommended!"
"Horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book is not only a smack in the face of the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic but also has the worse actor to play the title role of John Constantine. Keanu Reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well. The cinematography is ugly, making the movie a real eye sour and the special effects lack a certain feel to it. Out of the entire cast, only Rachel Weisz comes out with her dignity intact with a very good performance that the movie squanders in order to let Keanu act like a darker version of his NEO character towards the latter half of the film. They should have taken the material seriously and made a great horror movie out of it but instead, we have a children's movie that geared to Matrix heads.Avoid this film like the plague."
Don't listen to the people who are giving this 1's and 2's. This is the best book i have ever read! If you like fantasy books you definately have to read this!
"I have to admit this CD is my most major disappoint so far this year. There just doesn't seem to be much energy left in GVSB. I've always suspected that Scott McCloud was the real talent behind this group, and he's the only one who still sounds like he's holding up, the rest of them just fizzle. This impression was reinforced when I saw them peform at the Mercury Lounge on a trip to New York a few weeks ago. McCloud came through (barely), but the others acted half dead. Johnny Temple in particular seemed out of it. I was pretty close to the stage and he looked sort of tired and stressed, so maybe he was having an off night. I hope so. Otherwise it looks like this is going to be GVSB's last hurrah."
"Puss in Boots is a wonderful story. This book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art. A great read aloud with exceptional illustrations. Children and adults adore it. Presenting this tale to children takes great thought though. Try to avoid the dishonesty, terrorism, and thievery and focus on resourcefulness, first impressions, and survival. Fred Marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time. Wish he had a website!"
"By far this is the worst book in the series. Maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development, 200 pages of dry political education, and 100 pages on ballet recitals. Dry and pointless reading."
"No one can tell you what the experience of changing churches is like unless they have been there! This book is presented with wise counsel from ministers who have been there. Much of the advice you receive first hand on this subject is less than adequate because it is not thorough. When you study all of these essays together they are sincere, simple, and complete. This is a must read for those who are stuggling with the choice to move. The one knock I would make on the book is that sometimes it is not time to move and the book says very little about when to stay where you are. More detail should be given to the decision making process."
I have no idea why this movie did as bad as it did. In my opinion it was a truly fun film. It had a great mix of sports gags and situational comedy. Matt Stone And Trey Parker had so much fun doing this. I could not stop laughing at Dian Bachar. He was incredibly funny as Squeak. Don't miss out on this film. Funniest movie of 1998.
I had to buy this book for a Masters degree course. I think a fair amount of data is contained within the text but the organization style is not that good. The author drops hints that he has been writing this book for a long time and that it has helped some major names in the database world find inspiration... that's all well and good but a good book does this not make.The price is obviously way too much for something that is not really a practical guide. Most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to. What a shame...it would be much nicer to have a quality product to learn from. This is not it in my opinion. It could be done better.
"I am happy with this product and they are spill proof as stated. I would love to see a cover to make this product leak proof too! If you lay the travel water bowl flat they do not spill, however they do spill if you place them in an upright position. I place these in the freezer and then take these to the fields to water the dogs while we are planting.My chocolate lab has no problem drinking from this product."
"This is a good binder. I only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. If you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder. Also the expansion is limited in that you start from 3"" and expand to 5"" inches. The binder cannot collapse smaller than 3"". So as long as these two items are not an issue, it is sturdy and durable"
I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can't always catch it on TV.
"Highly energetic and downright rowdy quartet.It's hard to tell where improv ends & Khalife begins; brilliant~This group obviously plays together seamlessly -- like the Beatles over time.I'm sending JADAL to my percussionist grandson, along with Alhaj's ""When the Soul is Settled"" CD. Oud masters both, yet so delightfully different."
"During a snowstorm, eight women are stranded in a French country home with the corpse of the murdered family patriarch. Slightly bizarre, low-key French film pokes fun at the comedy murder mystery genre while heralding the feminine mystique of domesticity and dominance. It has the added distinction of breaking into song from each of the eight principal players, a strangely satisfying technique that often delivers touching portraits of womankind. This is as intoxicating as a glass of fine French wine."
"All shows on this set are the edited versions. Each show is missing more than 3 minutes of footage. The other set from this company is the same. If you want the original un-cut versions then skip these. If you don't mind having missing footage, then go for it. Personally, I would rather"" NOT "" have something than have shows the way these are."
Dan Tyminski's CD Carry Me Across The Mountain is cool and on the cover of the CD is Dan Tyminski playing the F - Style Nandolin.
"I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped."
"First, I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken. He has a magnificent voice that I feel the ""powers that be"" tried to turn into just another pop singer. I'm not saying the songs are bad, I'm just saying some of them weren't easily recognized as Clay's voice. I would have loved more ballads with the backgrounds a little quieter so Clay could shine through. Let's hope the next album has more of Clay, less pop attitude."
I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it
This is the best death-wish in this one bronson goes head-to-head with a gang that took over a 6 block radious of new york bronsons gun is very cool the ending is great and the music is cool cheak it out.
"I bought this to replace my original HP 4L Laser jet after 15 years. This seems to do a great job so far, much faster downloads and clean print,BUT BEWARE.... IT DOES NOT COME WITH A USB CORD TO CONNECT, so if the printer your replacing has the old stle connecter (as mine did) be ready to spend another $35.00 for a usb cord. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
This is an excellent book. Well researched. A little heavy sledding in some places. Author does a fair job of showing where he is speculating and where he is reporting.
"This band is amazing. Like everybody else, the first song I ever heard was Absolutely (story of a girl), and I bought the CD because that song was great. But the rest of the CD is even better. ""If I Am,"" ""Sometimes,"" ""Crazy,"" and all the other songs on the CD are gorgeous. They shouldn't be compared to other five person bands like Matchbox 20 or Vertical Horizon because they blow the hell out of those bands. Nine Days are five truly gifted musicians who deserve to go platinum one million times over. Everyone should by this CD because I guarantee there is not one track on it that will disappoint you. Nine Days is a breath of fresh air in the music world and should not be missed. Buy this CD!"
I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.
"I waited in anticipation for the release of this album. I think it's awful with the exception of two tracks - ""Measure of A Man"" and ""This is the Night"". The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time. It sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music. The wonderful voice we heard on ""American Idol"" is certainly not evident on this CD. The lack of ballads is disappointing - he's certainly not cut out to be the next rock star - please don't try to portray him as such."
"Mars Rising is the best documentary I've ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner's voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the ""manned mission to Mars"" genre."
"I thoroughly enjoyed Sam's letters to Jennifer! I am an avid James Patterson Fan (especially of the Alex Cross Series) and to read something different like this from Mr. Patterson, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy as much. However I have come to realize that to be a GREAT Author, you need to show some diversity. Well Mr. Patterson certainly shows that in this book. Its well written, a quick read and very emotional! I loved it!The book is about Sam (the grandmother), Jennifer (the grand-daughter) and Brendan (the lost love). Sam had left letters for Jennifer to read that showed that Sam's life wasn't at all as picture perfect as people may have believe it to be. It showed Sam's unhappiness with her husband and her new found love in another man. Upon coping with her own life in the big city, and now coping with Sam and then Brendan, we see how strong Jennifer is and how much her love for her grandmother, will get her through."
"This radio is insanely over-priced. You can get worse, but you can't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is a true piece of crap. Do not purchase it.I bought mine brand new in the box for two dollars at a church yard sale. Boy am I glad I didn't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is cheaply constructed all the way around. Everything about this shoddy radio is cheap cheap cheap. Want poor reception? You got it! Want brittle plastic that breaks easily? You got it! Want a compass that doesn't work? You got that too!Be prepared to do quite a bit of research to find an emergency radio worth owning. If it says ""Made in China"" avoid it if you can. If China does make anything worth owning they certainly don't export it to the USA.""Oregon Scientific"" is another term for cheap piece of Chinese crap.You will regret it if you buy this radio.Caveat emptor."
"This BBC produced docudrama displays its roots - the British apparently cannot get beyond the fact that Wernher von Braun was the mastermind behind the V2 program. I can't say I blame them, that's human nature, but it must be factored in by viewers who are not fully aware of the facts. After watching this program, an uninformed viewer would be left with the impression that virtually everyone working on the American program was morally, intellectually and patriotically inferior to their Russian counterparts.Viewers will probably enjoy the drama but should take it cum grano salis."
"This is easily the greatest example any teacher/professor could use in teaching how NOT to write a book.It's clearly a novel, full of exaggeration, distortion,and in many places complete lies.May God have had mercy when Loraine tried explaining his part in his false witness crusade against the the Church, our 2000 year old Catholic Church!"
"Bought this for a weather experiment. Could only produce 1.19 gigawatts, had to seek out another source that was very unpleasant to work with."
"Ok, as yall might know me, im Gamer8. To the game. This game is sorta like the first NBA Street game for the PS2. It has some flaws, such as lighting. Also, at points of the game, you might say, is this game worth $50.00? Well, its worth about $30.00. 1.- Its not a good game for portability. 2.- Lighting is bad at times 3.-Can be hard for beginners. So I suggest that you must know what the first few NBA Street games are about before buying thsi title. PS:Its a fun game after a while"
I received my shipment of this Blu-ray disc in excellent condition and in record delivery time. Thanks!
"Pearl Jam have changed considerably since 1991's debut ""Ten"", and this excellent collection of songs mirror a band clearly more at ease with life than they were in the early 90s. Lead single ""Nothing as it Seems"" makes up for it's lack of bite with the exploration of soundscapes born in the Mid West, while ""Light Years"" and ""Thin Air"" show a subtlety in the band's personality that went previously unexplored. My only gripes are with the absence of a real grabber like ""Jeremy"" or ""Rearviewmirror"", and the trowaway nature of ""Grievance"", but, hell, I'm only nitpicking. Lovely."
"This model TiVo is out of date. It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def. You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $1.50/month plus a $20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $12.95 (as I recall) -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition.I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths, then $12.95 there after.Oh did I mention that if you have Vonage or cable telephone service that you MUST buy a wireless adapter for ~$50.00?This is not only an outdated piece of equipment, but a very expensive solution to recording TV programs/movies!"
"I choose this book because it was economically priced. The book was kind of in rough condition on the outside cover, but the inside was totally fine. The description of the book was completely accurate."
"Still Life captures the sounds from the band's Tattoo You tour, which was their first extensive tour of the US in several years. The band sounds tight and revitalized. It is interesting to hear them play ""Start Me Up"" as it is was a new song at the time and they hadn't yet played it a million times. ""Shattered"" and ""Just My Imagination"" are roaring and their version of The Miracles ""Going To A Go-Go"" is a crowd pleaser. ""Under My Thumb"" is another very strong cut and it has a unusual, but perfectly fitting, intro with Duke Ellington's ""Take The 'A' Train"". Still Life shows the band at the peak of their concert playing, where the songs still sound fresh and haven't become old warhorses."
My teenage daughter and I both enjoyed reading this series. This book in particular was full of interesting insight as to how people may have lived and communicated pre-ice age. Very well written and enjoyable to read. Caution -- not for younger readers due to sexual content.
"Lauren I love you and your music I generally don't liste to younger artists because of the violence they promote, but you're style is so different and you give all honor to God first and foremost. The CD is just ""Awesome"" keep up the good work."
"West-West yall! This album is good for what it is meant to be, West coast Gangsta music. It's all about lowridin, smokin chronic, kickin' it and gangbangin in the Golden State. Those who are accustomed to Down South music will probably not like some of the west coast funk. It's a different flavor for some. Me being from Cali, I love this stuff. It is rare that someone captures the essence of the west. I do agree with this not being the best album but it's still worth buying. It's got enough head-bangers to get you to the club. That's Cali-4-ya.... 3 1/2 stars"
"I'm not sure why this book got so many five star reviews. It's not a terrible book, but I found it to be incrediably predictable and dull. I had pretty much figured out everything that was going to happen within the first hundred pages or so. There wasn't much point in finishing it. I love long books, but this one was pointlessly so. Wolfe goes into a lot of useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot. I found myself skimming many of the pages without feeling I has missed out on anything important. Definately the sort of book you read only if there is nothing else around."
"""Nebula Awards Showcase 2006"" is another collection of stories that you read and don't forget immediately. Another great-deal-treasure through Amazon."
"Well, to be really honest with you, I didn't like this book. Personally, I though Ann Rinaldi could've done a little better. Some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful, but the rest is kind of dull. At some points in the book, Emily, the main character, is lying so much to her Uncle Valentine and is being so selfish, it's like, ""okay, so when's she going to tell the truth or at least realize what she has done?"""
"What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer, have never surfed, I was just looking for a good video, and everybody recommended this to me.) But maybe now I'll be surfing by summer!"
"Trout Fishing In America make kids music, they do it well, and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it, even with adults, although I highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it's own merits. If you need a CD for your kids to listen to that won't drive you crazy, you have found it, but otherwise this is probably not a CD you want to own."
"This has become one of my most valued counseling companions. For those of you who are familiar with Glasser's Choice Theory, this is a great look into his actual practice techniques as he relates real case studies he has lead and how he has applied CT in real-life situations.Great read as well as a super resource."
"This picture transfer on Blu-Ray is definitely reference quality and worth bragging about and showing off to your Hi-Def junkie friends.I can't comment on the lossless audio quality since I cannot decode quite yet.This is a ""must have"" for any Blu-Ray collection."
"The CPD's are by far the best band alive in America today. ""Zoot Suit"" is the best CD of the year. On stage, I have never seen a band more charged and on fire than the CPD's. All other swing is boring lounge music compared to Zoot Suit. Steve Perry is one of the top three lyric writers on my personal list, making their music all the more enjoyable. The lyrics are complex, intelligent, morally pointed, and clever. The music is rich, catchy, diverse, and incorporates more instruments than other swing bands. The CPD's are definitely not smooth and syrupy like other bland bands. They have the same demented, spastic gusto they started out with years ago, and are only going to get hotter. All other bands, including the ""masters"" of days-gone-by swing (with all due respect, of course), are left foundering in the wake of the CPD's."
"I thank God for the writer of this book. This book explains new insight on Jesus' parables, taking in consideration of the Lord's geographical location and culture.It took me a while to read this book. Why? Because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it. Its not something that you read and let bygones be bygons.This book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as Jesus' followers. It addresses issues like greed or Me-society that we often ignore. I'd like to stress out that Jesus pointed everything plainly for us. This book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if God is really what motivates us in everything we do.I love this book and will give it to friends I know. Please pray for me so I can share it to others as well, and also put the Jesus' words into action.Thank God."
"I'm not much for writing book reviews, but this book was so good that I decided to do so anyway. The author has really done a comprehensive treatment of the subject of college scholarships. This is the scholarship book to get."
"Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10,000 times better acting and a much more coherent plot too!"
this is the best a+ book i have been reading easy to understand and brilliant video plenty of studying about core hardware i wish there was more of it especially about windows.good questions and answers programme pity it stops before you you even reach halfway.thank youpraful
"The name of this book is what caught my eye, but, as soon as I opened it, I realized how great it is. I learned of quite a few mistakes I make, and often WHY. The author's somewhat ranting tone makes an otherwise dense and boring subject a bit more approachable. I highly recommend this book."
"I explored the BD-live feature for the first time last night, and most of the functions require registration on Disney's site. On Disney's site an FAQ asserts that those features are being discontinued, and account creation is no longer possible. WTH? This disc was only released 8 months ago, and the much-heralded BD-Live features that personalize your disc and experience are already outdated.For what it's worth, I just bought UP (released last week), and the BD-Live features from Disney appear to be nothing but downloading trailers for other films ... four of them. My verdict on Disney BD-Live => total waste of time."
"The translation may be a little enigmatic at times, but the core of the material is extraordinary. As a historical document, it reflects on the ideals that defined the Samurai spirit, and laments the loss of this selfless nature."
"Victoria Hamilton seems to pop up everywhere, whether in lesser parts as in Pride and Prejudice, in ""bad girl"" parts such as in Mansfield Park, or in this delightful version of the complex relationship between Victoria and Albert. This one needs to be compared with a somewhat different interpretation of the relationship in ""The Young Victoria."" Victoria's handling of her long period of grief over Albert's death is also well done in ""Mrs Brown."" For English history lovers, all of these are worth viewing, interesting, and nicely filmed."
"Why did they call it ""Season of the Witch?"" There's suppose to be a witch in this movie? I really don't like this movie. It has nothing to do with the rest of the series. A factory produces masks with a computer chip installed on them that turns children's heads into snakes and insects. What the heck is the purpose of that! This movie should be on Mystery Science Theatre 3000."
"Yeah... I'm going to have to ""go ahead"" and rent this movie again because I missed most of it due to the fact that I was laughing too hard to keep up with the story line.Seriously though, this movie was simply the best movie I've ever seen. Other than the types of people the movie was being critical of, (mindless corporate suits and drones), I can't imagine anybody not loving this film."
"This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years, I was not completely impressed by the movement or character development in this book. I have read all of Grisham's books and would easily place this near the bottom of the list.The initial concept is interesting, but his storytelling was lackluster and characters a bit cliched.I kept thinking the ""crime family"" resembled the Clampetts and his protaganist was unbelievable at times. A lot of the characters were shallow, and the end was disappointing.If you are going to read this, wait for the paperback or get it from the library.Or just re-read the good ones: A Time to Kill, The Client, The Brethren and The Pelican Brief."
"I was totally enthralled by this entire series, even the Sherlock Holmes style story of Stonecutter but this ending was horrible. Took a perfectly good sword and sorcery series and turned it sci-fi. I'll read sci-fi when I want that, I read this series for magic and swordplay. I'd read the entire series again and simply leave this one out."
"My favorite songs on this album are ""Too good to be true"" and ""Ex-Factor"". Lauryn's singing/rapping talents are amazing! (Not to mention her acting talents,too) I was impressed by her strong voice and incredible rhythm. This album definitly deserves the grammys it was nominated for. I can't wait for Lauryn's next album and would absolutly love to see her perform live!!!"
"I love Kala as well, because it sounds cleaner and more developed. However this album was an excellant break out in her career. fire, fire is one of my favorites. Mix with marijuana."
"I have read this book in both Spanish and English I believe it is simply the best novel written in the 20th century. No where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one. It touches my soul with a something magical, creating the world of the Buendias inside of me. Someone once said finishing the book is like waking from a dream. I agree."
"I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel."
"This book was an overall 1 star book. The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic. This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action. The characters, however were very interesting and original. The events were very boring and predictable."
"This book makes it clear that Helen Fisher hates men. If a man wrote a book like this from the male perspective, he would be justly crucified by the media. This book is a blow to the good reputation of the Anthropology Department at Rutgers University, where she was apparently employed at the time of publication. I would like to say something positive about the book, in order to balance out some of the negatives, but I can't think of anything except maybe that it is a good addition to the library of anyone who collects the works of notable bigots. In short, a truly horrible book."
"I have had this book for awhile,now,and the only thiong I dont care for are the colored charts...I just cant do them,as a LOT of people cant,especially the older we get. I have a ginger tabby named Sassy who looks just like the cat on the cover...she is draped over a sofa....having that piece will forever remind me of her after she is no longer here to drape over the couch.....You wont be disappointed if you can get by the colored charts. In fact I gave it 4 stars because of the colored charts...."
"Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is a great book to read.It is a book about how George, a small quick guy helps Lennie, a big guy, who is not very smart.Through the story George always helps Lennie.This book makes you want to keep on reading to find out what happens.My favorite part about Of Mice and Men is that it has a sad ending.It's not one of those boring story's where it has a happy endind.This book is more unique."
"Super handy and looks legit, even though it's TruTone! And because it's less than $10, it makes great gifts! I've bought quite a few just to give away to my fellow church-goers!"
"Rated at 1000mAh, just like the original Panasonic battery for my TZ5. Only had 1/2 the life at first. A little over a year later, it only lasted for 4-8 picture and 3-5 minutes' worth of video. After a year and a half, this battery is dead. Not even recommended as a backup. Spend the extra few dollars and get one with a better user rating, more mAh, or better yet, just get the Panasonic.*Update: I returned it under their 3 year warranty (though they now say it's only 2). I had to pay $2 to ship it back to them (which is fine), and now they say I owe them another $7.50 for shipping and handling. Wow, this battery only costs $7.14 new right now.**Update #2: I ignored their request for another $7.50, but after a month or so, they sent me a new one anyway (which has been sitting in my desk ever since, since I bought a higher quality backup battery in the meantime...the Kinamax 1300mAh S007 for about 15 bucks)."
A magnificent and wholly believable performance by Russel Crowe. You;d almost want to pick up a gladius and follow him yourself!
"Rather than letting his subjects tell their stories Brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy. I donated my copy to the city library. Instead, read Studs Terkel's ""The Good War."" It ""is"" what Brokaw could have ""had"", if he would have imitated the master oral biographer."
"Small book with somewhat large type, not finished reading it, and not really buying into it yet (maybe too soon to tell).My Amazon purchase included 3-publications (similar ilk). Within a very short time (minutes) of making the online purchase, there was an identity hack against my credit card. Coincidence?I'm reconsidering making future purchases through Amazon."
This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga. I cant stand it. It also borrows a few ideas from the Dragon Riders of Pern and Lord of the Rings. It may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic.
"This soundtrack is truly a piece of art. Randy Newman has done some great things with this album. ""When She Loved Me"" is a beautiful song that I can't help but listen to over and over again. The instrumental part (which makes up the majority of the album) is exciting yet very soothing and enjoyable. If you've seen the movie, and paid any attention to the music at all, the soundtrack is a must. I put it in my CD player, sit back, and relax. I'll listen to this one for years to come."
"i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs, you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working it's way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity. For kylie minogue i can find many uses - for her music i find none."
Cooperative games help keep the peace at our house and this is the one we play the most. We have so much fun working together to try to beat the robber--no tears at the end of this game!
"I am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question. Judging by my screen name, one can safely assume that I am a Will Oldham fan. I, myself not being much of a writer, will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmedia.com and nme.com."
"The amazing thing about this book was that it was written by a 15 year old. But the bad thing is that it was horrible. The charactors were so much like LOTR. I felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action. It also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling. I also felt that is was hard to love the charectors. They all(old or young) had the heart of a 15 year old. Brom,the old wise rider, lacked the wiseness that charectors such as Gandalf had. Overall I hated this book and i dont intend on reading the rest of the series."
This is a good quality life vest. I am pleased with the fit and feel. I wear it faithfully on our boat!
"the set-up requirement for the Tivo wireless connector to my Apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network. When Tivo worked on the network, my printer didn't. It was less of a hassle to get an ethernet cable and plug it in."
"This collection amounts to three dollar-store discs jammed into a pretty package. For those who prefer substance over style, look elsewhere for this material, which is given a pretty shoddy presentation overall.Disc 3 (which was unplayable on the two DVD players I tried it on) repeats the entire contents of Disc 2, and adds the TV pilots Kook's Tour and Jerks Of All Trades -- making Disc 2 a pointless redundancy. Avoid it at all costs."
"I have been a exercise dvd junkie for years, Kettlebell dvds also. Although I like the exercises presented, I have some issues with her form. I know from personal experience, if you don't have your form correct, you can cause injury to other parts of your body as I did with my knees. Also, if you're advanced, you will be working out without her instruction, as she only does the beginner workout with you. Normally, trainers will either let beginners know when their time is up and continue on with the advanced exercisers. Lisa stops working out at the beginners level, which leaves you still working out by yourself, hopefully, finishing in time for the next exercise. I did pick up some good exercises but don't use this dvd as often as I would have liked. I will be sending it down the ""resell"" road."
"This is an ok book. It is action packed and holds your attention. I think that the main charecter, Dick Shelton, is a lot like many people today even though the book takes place in Medieval times. Dick did not know that he was fighting for his enemy Sir Daniel, the man who had killed his father. I think this is one of the best historical fiction books that I have ever read. I hope that you will like it as much as I did."
WANTED to watch the behind the scenes Jailhouse Rock clip but unfortunately Amazon feels the need to ruin it by peddling Elvis product with the damn pop ups thru the whole thing. Maybe if I could actually enjoy the clip I might buy the dvd. Just because of the annoyance factor I am not. You suck Amazon
"I found this dictionary outstanding quality. As a person who's english is not a first language, I love the unlimited variety words and the detailed descriptions of each words. I hoped if the book isn't so big and heavy but I guess it's impossible for this dictonary. I like to recommend to evrybody and I have so. For new buyers, you won't regret. People might think this dictionary is not much different from the oxford but THIS is quiet an extraordinary..."
"This radio has the same features that most $300+ radios have, yet it's less than $100. The full channel scanning and DualWatch work great and to be such a compact unit with such a small speaker the audio sounds good. If you will be driving with the windows down go ahead and plan for an external speaker but for any other time the built in speaker works great. Once setup with a tuned antenna the transmit and receive are both great. A great radio for a great value!"
"I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the ""bunny ears"" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product."
This book contains very good practice material but the explanations to the answer choices are very vague and difficult to understand.
"A fast read, has some helpful teaching points and very general commentary on japanese society. Seems a bit outdated too, at least my 1992 edition does. A lot of time spent covering things you could easily look up on the web. If you are going to Japan through JET, you will have heard a lot of this stuff by the time you get to Japan. Definitely check this out in a bookstore before buying, probably give it a pass."
"I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles,(but he sometimes picks horrid roles). The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn't horrible but it was rather predictable. What made me give it 4 stars is the fact that Hugh Jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova. What took Hollywood so long to find him?"
"Good Price with a nice package, but very poor quality sound. We purchased 2 of these phones...both had echo, and low sound quality. We could not even have a conversation with the other party. Both are being returned!!"
"I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18$ but I was so wrong! Not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were NO EXTRAS on either the blu ray or the regular dvd!! They rushed this out to trick us all. This is worth 5$ not 20$! For 20$ I bought the extended edition blu ray/DVD combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over 4 hours of extras! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERISON! THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLE save your money and wait to see it with the extras! trust me!!! I returned this the day I got it, and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras!"
"Listening to this cd, I turned my car stereo all the way up, on my way back from work. The lyric is very ostentatious and the beats are showy. 10 dollars and Hombre are two of my favorite tracks, they are both clever yet funny. It does have a political overtone, but it's ok, I like the revolution type mood. It's actually very good stuff when you are on a plane, totally blocks out the crying sound of babies next seat, and you can imagine a party in your head."
"We had this machine at work and made maybe 6 cups a day on a busy day. Within a month the machine broke - Keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well (a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem!!). they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going. The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE, AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP. COME ON PEOPLE LETS HAVE SOME CONSCIOUS COMSUMERISM AND SLOW DOWN. What ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you. If you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans!"
These diapers are too expensive and leaky than other diapers. Usually i don't buy them because of high cost but I bought them for the first time thinking that they will be gud but they were the oppsosite. They leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps. I usually use LUVS DIAPERS. They are far betther than these and cheaper as well. I made a great mistake thinking that if it is expensive it will be good.People don't waste your money in this junk product.
"Why is this album held in such high regard? It sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records. The gritty heart-felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold, synthetic, superficial beats, create an unsettling tension that sounds unintended. He should be made to leave his room and go out and get some exercise."
"This was a good book. It was a bit long, in that the whole book is based off of one day. It was interesting, in that I wanted to see what would happen to Miss Pettigrew, overall a good book, glad I got to read it."
"As one who has never attended a Yoga class, I am fascinated by this book because I feel as though I am doing Yoga as I sit and read and think, read and think. Yoga is so much more than being on a mat, although that experience is certainly most central to the discipline. What I am discovering is the meaning of the discipline. I am able to envision the physical movements as I sort out, mentally, the meaning of my imagined activity. Because Gates puts his readers through stages of using their minds, he also expects those readers to repeat those stages over and over. In repeating the exercises, readers bring new thoughts and experiences to the reading activity and each exposure is different from the last one. As such, the book is always new, exciting, provocative, mysterious, riveting."
I'm a big Louis Prima fan but I was very disappointed with this cd. It didn't capture the excitement of a Louis Prima show.
"I did not do a scientific study, but I don't think the new battery that I received holds more or longer charge than my worn out 3 1/2 year old battery. When I got the battery it looked a bit beat. I called and they assured me that it is new. The person said that the batteries ship bulk in a bag and they get beat up. I'm not thrilled with the performance. I am skeptical and will not do it again. Cannot recommend it."
"Alot of stuff for Nokia is GSM only. Pull off your battery, and take a look at your Nokia phone. The older phones that alot of people carry is TDMA/CDMA, like the 5185. Guess what? It dosen't work."
"Although verbose and extremely detailed, still enjoyable and a fast read. In just 100 pages I feel I've come to know so much about Nureyev's life and the passion that drove him to become the world's most famous ballet dancer."
"... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony, the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film. In short, he doesn't act at all; like Yahweh, he just 'is that he is.'Take a look at the expression on the face of Ms Barrymore in the picture on the DVD cover; that's exactly how I look when I find myself watching another Adam Sandler film. Unfortunately, my teenage son and my two twenty-something nieces all find Sandler rib-splitting funny. Being a companionate adult, therefore, I sit cross-legged among them and gape at the screen, forcing a chuckle now and then like a losing presidential candidate at a town meeting. Then sometimes I offer to run out for ice cream...."
I ordered this expecting it to come with a 3.5mm connection but came with a different connection. Although it says designed for zune the pictures are misleading so if your looking for a universal transmitter make sure it is in fact universal. This transmitter is great rarely get static and its stereo so thats a plus!
"Words can only do a disservice to the scope and deep emotion that this album not only invokes, but also infuses in its listeners.Listening to this one remembers the strength and power personified in the great Sojourner Truth's epochal poem, ""Ain't I A Woman.""Listen to it yourself and you will see...you sure are a woman Lauryn Hill."
"This book has only gained by the passage of time since it was written. It is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as ""constrained"" vs the modern Liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper. He actually makes the best case I have read for the Liberal position, and it is still sorely lacking. I am so grateful that he lives and writes."
This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie.
IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT WAS ROMANTIC AS WELL AS EXCITING. NOTHING COULD EVER TOP IT. PATRICK SWAYZE IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THE WORLD AND JENNIFER GREY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO.
"This book was a wonderfully light and entertaining read. Kit is a young girl who is forced to leave her island home of Barbados in the late 1600's and live with a strict Puritan community in Connecticut. She has many new relationships some good and some bad in this land where life seems so harsh. One of her special relationships is with an elderly Quaker woman, the Witch of Blackbird Pond. The author is detailed in showing early New England life. The characters are a charming and I will always remember Hannah Tupper. A fabulous book for adults, young and old."
even though it was damaged in shipping this charger works great and i would recomend it to anyone it charges fast and since it has a fan it does not over heat like most chargers
If you loved watching this on TV as a child you will be surprised at the language in this version. If you are sensitive to profanity - don't get it.
"I ordered this to replace a missing copy for our home collection. The HP movies are our favorites, and we watch them often. I loaned Goblet to someone, can't remember who, and it's been more than a year. I finally decided to admit it's not coming home, and ordering a new one. Unfortunatly, you get what you pay for here. I was excited to find a coopy for around five dollars (and didn't think twice about it, since Blue Ray is becoming popular, and it's an older movie now) but when we watched it last week, the DVD plays, but skips and catches every 10 minutes or so and the picture looks 'off'. I haven't bothered trying to replace it, since it was only a few dollars, but I will be looking for a real copy soon."
"""Blow"" is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of ""blow"" is kind of hard to figure out, it is an interesting movie to watch, and you find yourself mysteriously rooting for Jung as he rises and falls.The best part of this film is the first part detailing Jung's rise to fame, and his doomed relationship with his first girlfriend. The shots of California and the beach are the quintessential way that we all wish it truly were.Somewhat depressing, somewhat amusing, and always entertaining, you won't go wrong adding ""Blow"" to your collection. Depp is always good in all his roles."
"i saw this movie this past summer it,s a good movie it,s better than other two batman movies batman forever and batman and robin. this movie got something right as far the comic goes theJoker did n,t kill bruce pranets keaton did a better job as batman mr bale played a good batman this movie. Has Minor actor in it a good saga review 7/10"
"Don't waste the classics on kids. I remember having to read and write book reports on musty old classic books in school, dull and boring. Now I am ready to enjoy these books. Great Expectations shows how much of our lives are lived on incomplete information. The hero assumes that he knows who is guiding and helping him to live and grow beyound his simple beginnings, only to discover at the end that nothing he assumed was true. The hero does live up to the expectations of his benefactor, and beyond the expectations of many others. He also finds out what it is to be given a better future and how much you owe to those that believe in you. I enjoyed this story and recomend you read (reread) this enlighting story of growing up."
"I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them."
"My children are a little old (age-wise) for this, but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year. This classic will never die out, as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come.Having always been a huge fan of Charlie Brown to begin with, this is, by far, my favorite Christmas special. I can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday. Charles Shulzz did one amazing job with this classic. This short animated special shows children the true meaning of Christmas, and Linus' delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching.This classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but especially by families with small children. This is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection."
"Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."
"I like David and have seen him live. The beginning of this book was pretty good, but then I just lost interest. There were the occasional laugh out loud sections, but it seemed like they weren't coming often enough to keep me choosing this book over others. So I say it just wasn't good enough."
I'm trying to locate the abridged version that I taught from in the 60s. It's out of print and I would love to get come copies of it if anyone has any to use with my not-so-good readers now.If you find any please call me at 949-854-8889.
"I remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again. I had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following Tess through her trials and tribulations, albeit some self imposed."
I remember when i was about ten watching this movie the one thought i couldn't get out of my mind is that this [stuff] really happend. From the moment that creepy guy jumps in there van and starts talking about how he worked in a slaughter house and then starts cuttin on his self the movie has your attention. I really dont know what else to say that hasn't allready been said so i just want to say love this DVD. 5/5.
"I really like watching the 15-mins Spongebob Squarepants episodes on TV; they're very innocent and happy, but when I watched this movie I almost lost my head because of the awful it was! This is actually ""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever"", the critics here in Chile said that and I totally agree with them.The worst thing the producers could do was to include real people and stupid effects that make you laugh in the movie. Like David Hasselhoff, the made fun of himself by acting here!!!! plus, the stupid effect when he starts acting as if he was a boat or something, I had self-shame when I watched that part!!!!!I think that the worst thing you could do is to buy this DVD: you'll watch it once, you'll hate it and you'll waste 18 bucks. Bad purchase."
"I found this exact same product for $7.99 today at Walgreens. This is a sale price, however, even regular price is less than this. I feel some/many of the mega diaper packs on amazon are a good deal, but not this one."
"I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: ""it was kinda boring."" If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters."
Langston Hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist. I found this book to be lack luster and boring. Although you may like a character or two...in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing. His wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
"I'm OK with paying for eBooks. I bought this one, but was so distracted by multiple scan-induced typographical artifacts that I requested (and received) a refund about two-thirds of the way through the book. Free eBooks force me to tolerate some typos, as those books are done by volunteers and not for profit. But, an $8 Kindle Book sold by Amazon should be free of such nuisances. This one wasn't, and I'm basing this review solely on the poor quality of the eBook itself, not the content or theme of this book. It's a shame to hype the Kindle format while simultaneously selling a sub-standard version of that very format!"
"content is great! the company that sent it to me, however, did not mention that the book would come in two parts!! I was horribly dissapointed. I am however, a Social Studies Teacher and I use this book ALL the time in my discussion of Pre-conquest Americas."
"I am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over. Tell them it's good, a thousnad times, and they will buy anything. It is an admirable thing to see Clive Davis become even more wealthy by pumping out more and more drivel for the masses to consume. A good clue to the quality of the five star reviews for this release can be found by the list of music purchases made by those who bought this CD:* CDs from The American Idol Series* Closer ~ Josh Groban* The Movie Album ~ Barbra Streisand* Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook ~ Bette Midler* One Heart ~ Celine Dion* The Very Best Of Cher ~ Cher* Buddy Jewell ~ Buddy Jewell* Michael Buble [ENHANCED] ~ Michael BubleIf lack of taste were a crime, all involved with this release would be in jail."
"this book was written before the pci express standard was ratified so much of the information is speculative. nevertheless, it is well written and complete."
The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
"Thought this film was very funny, well done. Acting was great, directing was gritty, but worked well for this movie, and it's story.Would highly recommend if you like dark comedies."
Thankfully I only paid [money] for this cd single. The original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for 4 minutes. Why do they pay dj's to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better. I think dj's have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers. My advice would be don't buy this until you have listened to it first.
"C-balance is an excellent product from a trusted hobbyist turned vendor Julian Sprung, this is also the best price available anywhere."
Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.
"I got a huge kick out of Vinny's interpretations of the Beatles' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped, as has been written here. But the don't mimic previous covers, but try to recreate the early Beatle sound. It's light and it's fun. It's is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you'll get a big kick out of this disc."
"A very sexy and entertaining film. Sure, this film is heartwarming and inspiring. It is also funny and pleasant. BUT it is also sexy, very sexy infact! And it is very enjoyable and entertaining. 5 stars!"
"It may start out boring but inside is the intense in-battle story against the British. This Revolutionary War story is about a young boy named Adam who sees his father and friends murdered on the battle line at Lexington. Together Adam, a crazy old X-British officer and some friends drive the British out (not alone, there was all of the other farmers too, they just stayed in a group). Un-like other revolutionary war storys this one takes place in a two day period with gruesome detials of war. Once you've read the book the movie is a cheap immation but fun none the less.<BR"
"I consider this the ""original"" Robin Hood. I never realized as a kid that this was one of my all-time favorite movies, but as an adult I realize that it was. I LOVE the music. Classic Disney"
"This is the best book in the field of creativity and accelerated learning!!! After only 15 minutes, I felt that my brain had a really good and hard workout."
"I'll tell you how stuped you can get, this movie is how stuped you can get. This is one of the STUPEDEST movie I have ever seen and trust me I've seen alot of movies.The whole movie is dumb exspecailly the actors.I recamend you not see this movie actshoally I more than recamend you I BEG you not to see this movie But if you incest to I recamend you borrow it from a friend your if you can't, rent it at the cheapest place you no before wasting your money on buying it. But if I were you I won't wast my money at all."
"A Dummy's Guide to Understanding Bizarre Murder Cases.-I would read this if you were a new immigrant to the Western world. So, i would look around for weightier books ,on a specific crime topic.This book is too broad and not informative enough .The reason why these cases haunt the FBI is that they need to turn on the light-switch."
"This is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points, but extremely weak on others. It provides the most detailed history of Westmoreland Glass that I have ever seen, and some of the facts are fascinating. However, it is very, very, very poorly organized. Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books. Unfortunately, I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet. Lorainne Kovar's books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should. I would NOT recommend Kovar's books on any subject."
"A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean."
This particular printing may be authentic to the period but the print is very difficult to read. It is dizzying.
"The product looks ok. The buttons are nice and big and easy to read. They don't work very well though. For example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often I have to press it several times and just right for it to work. It does not come with the AC adapter and Northwestern Bell no longer makes or distributes them. Without the adapter the lights do not work, including the message waiting light. It is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter. I have tried several stores such as Radio Shack, Best Buy, Walmart and Target to find an adapter (120VAC to 6V 100mA) and cannot find one. I have not been able to find one online either. Also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 AA batteries. It does not. This one takes 4 AAA batteries. Not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me, but the description is not accurate for the item. I am sending it back."
"Remember "" Don`t play your Rock`n Roll to me "" from Smokie? No? The Gallaghers gave a f... on that. They did what they can give but this one was not to the hand of God... The Following Album after this was going on Jesus Christ Ways; only 4 Albums on the World have the right beeing 6 points on Amazon. Defintiley Maybe this is not 6 points but a full 5.00000 ...."
"No wonder it sounds alot like Helooween. Kai Hansen, and some other former members of Helloween are in this band, which is actually a side/hobby-project for Kai Hansen and friends, disgruntled with not being able to play 80's style power metal, they formed this great band on the side of their regular bands, like Gamma Ray and other bands.Also worth noting is the fact that they've just released a 4-track mini-CD, ""Coming Home."" I bought it only yesterday, and it, needless to say, ROCKS! There's a live version of ""Atlantis is Falling"". The cover of Judas Priest's ""The Rage"" is also terrific."
I saw this in the movie theather. It rocked then and it still rocks. The story line is superb. The charactors are well written. The violence might scare some young ones. After I saw this movie I never stopped talking aobut it. I highly recommend it!
"This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times, too. I watch this movie often as I am a hopeless romantic and I thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix), plus it's worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts. It ends the way a typical relationship of this type would, but that's not exactly a bad thing in this case. I recommend it to everyone."
"Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of ""executive summary"" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view."
"I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind. The print is every bit as blurry as it every was before I tried the things in this book. I wanted so much for this to work, and I'll try again, but after four months of daily applying the techiniques of this book, my vision did not improve the least bit."
This collection of music is so cool. It gives you a quick glimpse of alot of different artists. It has nice catchy tunes all through the cd.
"As musicians, Bond really stands out, even on this DVD, but as show-women, they need a lot of work. Haylie quickly became annoying as the spotlight hog. And as a group, they didn't do much in the way of actual ""entertaining"". They simpy played their music. It may possible that it was planned that way....consider the British audience....but if that was the case, they should have recorded some other performance for release on DVD. In short, if you are a fan of Bond, you will want this, but don't expect too much from it."
"They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them."
"This is a lame and completely unbelievable movie straight from the 1950s-type phony monsters. A group of women decide to spelunk, with no ""flight plan"" filed with anyone. Then of course one of them chooses to take the rest into an unexplored cave without mentioning to the others that it could be is dangerous. With friends like that.....Then of course, in the cave, blind monsters (people in rubber suits) show up to murder all the women.First of all, why would such strong, fearless women in the beginning of the movie suddenly turn into cringing, screaming, and hysterical stereotypes.Secondly, the monsters are so badly done that one expects to see zippers on the back of their rubber suits.Steer clear of this movie. It is horrible. I was embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"This album is brilliant! If you buy it, I guarantee it'll be the best album you buy all year!"
This DVD has a few really enjoyeable songs. It is one of those videos that seeing it one time is enough. There are some good history points and traveling interest Daniel explains and good scenery of Ireland which make the video palatable. Too much video footage is of Daniel himself. I would recommed buying this DVD if you can get it for a low price.
"When this Lp came out in 1982, a Billboard ad stated 'The Most Powerful Instrument in Music Returns'....and it did! This Chaka lp is one of her best and it shows how to use Power Vocals correctly! I think this Lp was ahead of it's time...a Great fusion of R&B;, Funk & Jazz..Arif Mardin KNEW what to do with Khan's voice! 8 powerful examples of why Chaka Khan is one of the Greatest Singers ever!!I have this on vinyl & CD!!! :)"
"These cases are super brittle, I bought one recently from this seller, and in the past on ebay. In both instances the cases have been tough fits. The cases are SUPER brittle and will more than likely crack on you while screwing them on (like mine did). I am pretty upset at the cost of them for how cheap they are. I now have a nice transparent case with a huge crack down the middle and a DVD drive that wont open. .... not worth it"
"well, they don't taste like anything... and they're really hard to bite into - not crispy, just really hard. If you're a sailor from the eighteenth to ninteenth century and you're used to ""ship's biscuit"", then I'm sure you will love these as they've got more protein and better taste, and are also in nice sealed packages (no weavils!) They remind me of Woody Allen's line, ""I could make a lot of money selling these in a health food store.""I went for these because of all the rave reviews, and I am now dissapointed. I guess I can feed these to my boyfriend... he might eat them if he's really hungry and there's nothing else."
"I seldom *ever* find a book in my school library that is worth reading. This book was impossible to put down and kept me going back for more. I'm hoping the door is open for a sequel, which I'd buy right away."
"I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in, but not without considerable effort. Now that it's in the bike, I am a bit worried about it sealing properly. If I had it to do again, I would go with a different hi-flo aftermarket filter, or the OEM."
"This book is tiresome!!! Took real effort to read it all the way to the end. I was very much looking forward to this book which turned out to be a real snore. By the end of the first hundred pages I felt like Ayla was a prehistoric McGyver. Good grief, the needle, bow and arrow, etc., I wondering how it was she didn't invent electricity (wait, no, that was Ben Franklin). The effort to get to the end of definitely not worth it."
"This is the second HP printer I bought and frankly the only reason I tried this printer was because of the network connectivity. I haven't written many reviews before, but this product is soo bad that I had to add to the list of angry customers. Getting the printer to load 1 piece of paper is a nightmare. Now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine. Anyone see office space? yeah after I get my new Canon printer, i will re-enact that scene. perhaps i should record it and send it to HP?"
"Would I recommend it? Yes, but try to get it used. Also I would definitely buy their next in hopes that they may ""find themselves"" with a more well defined sound. You catch a bit of a sense that they are trying to be the Beastie Boys on another level... they need to just try to be Quarashi but they clearly aren't entirely sure who that is. The first track is by far the best on the album in my opinion, it absolutely rocks but the rest of it doesn't have the teeth that track does. If you like this first track don't buy the whole album for it, the entire album is only 41 minutes."
"257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman. If you want to read the same old 70's UFO stories, this is your book. If you want to read about the Mothman, buy something else."
"Well, if you missed this import single when it was released along with a handful more, you may fear you missed an Andy Bell gem. This track is a B-side for a reason. Totally inferior to anything on the full length CD. No, it's not an electro house dance track like much of what you'll find on the full length. It's a short, sort of campy cabaret style track that uses what sounds like a real band, including acoustic drums, guitar, and even a horn section. If you simply MUST have everything Andy Bell sings, then you do get plenty of his vocal, but if you're really more just about his classic dance sound, then pass on it. Ashame they couldn't have just thrown it in as a bonus track on the domestic maxi-single release of Crazy."
"Cheryl Brodersen is a gifted teacher. She's candid, humorous and real. I would say she has both her parents' (Chuck and Kay Smith) gifts of exhortation and teaching. Speaking from her heart, she helps you find God's grace in and through your trials."
"People complain about how this film uses some of the same historic footage ""Tora Tora Tora"" uses. This WWII footage is great and should be used in different war films. Just because it was used in that film dosent mean it can't be used in ""Midway"". It's not like they took scenes made for ""Tora Tora Tora"" and put them in this film. Historic footage is used and reused in many films. How many times have we seen scenes with President Kennedy in different films? The same populer footage of him? This film is an epic war masterpiece. The acting is superb. People complain about the Japanese speaking English. You are supposed to imagine them to be speaking Japanese. It's not like a mistake the film makers made that makes the film appear cheaper or something. This film gets very little credit, and is always in the shadow of ""Tora Tora Tora"". I think, if you collect war films, you should own both. ""Midway"" is a true classic."
"I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production, I was eager to see this video. Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song ""Any Dream Will Do"" to the BEGINNING of the show."
"There's only one reason to see this movie. Entertainment. It's just that simple. If you're looking for profound, this whole movie genre isn't it. If your looking for fast paced action, witty dialogue, an edgy sound track that compliments the plot... a wild, unique approach to stunts, and a totally unconventional, irreverent ""secret agent""... then this movie is for you.Vin Diesel makes a very entertaining, believable Xander Cage, but give him a break...this isn't a Shakespeare movie! It's a spy movie and does follow the genre rules, but not enough to make it like any other. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy the ride!"
"DID NOT MEET DESCRIPTION BY AMAZON.THERE WAS NO LISTING BY EACH ESSAY TITLE.THERE WAS NO DESCRIPTION IN EACH ESSAY OF MEANING OF ELIZABETHAN TERMS,NOR ANY TRANSLATION OF FREQUENT LATIN QUOTATIONS.NOR ANY INTERPRETIVE COMMENTS ON THE ESSAYS.ALL THESE THINGS ARE FOUND NORMALLY IN MODERN EDITIONS.THIS BOOK WAS DOWNLOADED FROM THE INTERNET AND IT SHOWS."
"I have been looking for an all natural shampoo, and this is a wonderful one. It made my hair incredibly soft with tons of body--I was incredibly surprised at how well it worked on my hair. The sample is worth the price just to test it out."
"While the sound quality on these disks is excellent, be aware that app. 50% of the tunes are not the originals. Shout Factory should be ashamed, duping customers like this. Rhino Records would never pull such a stunt. Go for the 4-disk Rhino box set (Vol. One) instead. You can find many high quality used versions for sale all over the web, too."
"I'd never heard of James Tipper until I heard about this CD on a newsgroup. I rarely buy CD's based on one song but I did this time and was very suprised. It has lots of different styles and moods so you don't get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of CD's. There's something for everyone. I like the techno sounding stuff like Bioluminescence and Evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano. Lyrics are great and there are clever production touches. Overall, money well spent."
"Three words...BUY A BOPPY! Its not just for breastfeeding moms, though I can definately see how it would be a great asset for those who choose to breastfeed.I've used it during feedings, to take some strain off my arm (because baby can get heavy to hold in an upright position that is best for bottle feeding.) I've also used it to prop my baby up in a sitting position and she loves it! She looks so comfortable, I almost wish they made adult size boppys :-) I have also put it around my waist (and yes, it does bring back prego memories!) and layed the baby in it so she can snuggle close to me while my hands are free to do other things (read, change the channel, etc.) A great buy for every parent!"
Earrings came quickly and as described. Hard to find these little peace sign earrings in a style that is not obnoxious. Perfect gift for 70's sister.
"Francie is a girl who is dirt poor, and living in Brooklyn during harsh times. Francie is strong through the horrible things that happen to her during the course of her life. I cried, I laughed, and I felt the pain that Francie felt. Francie also deals with the tradgedy of her fathers death. Not to mention almost being raped. This book also deals with a girl becoming a woman. A must read book!!!!!"
"I have tried every ice pack on the market! The ace ones are great, but every single one leak! No matter how careful I am with them.....they leak at the seams. These are less expensive and with proper care last forever! When using them cold, you do need a cover of some sort........an old pillow case works well folded over several times. Plus the size works well. Big enough to sit on your head for those migraines without falling off easily. Sometimes holding your head still to keep the ice pack on ends up hurting your neck, which makes your head worse. Defeats the purpose. For the money, this one is a good choice!"
Unfairly ignored during it's initial release this movie deserves another chance.Unlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse her.Michael J. Fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thing.Fox proves he's got what it takes to hold his own in a serious part(even better than Bright Lights Big City)and Sean Penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too far.I saw this in theaters in 1989 and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still hasn't lost it's impact.Director Brian DePalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matter.The haunting score by Ennio Morricone that accompanies the poor girl's ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long time.Tough to watch but extremely worthwhile if you're looking for powerful cinema.
"I bought this CD in hopes that some of Destiny's Child's songs would get a better beat or become more interesting for dancing. What I got was a horrible butchering of ""Emotion,"" a never-ending ""Bootylicious,"" a ""Say My Name"" mix anyone would be more than happy to do without and mixes of songs that weren't very good the first time around- several weren't even singles! (Dot, Nasty Girl, So Good)To make that sound better, they throw in Independent Women Pt. II, which is taken directly from ""Survivor,"" and hawk a song from Michelle Williams' upcoming solo debut (Heart to Your, Apr. 16). It's sad when the best song on a group's mix CD is one from the member going solo.I would not recommend this CD at all, if you like Destiny's Child, get Survivor or Writing's on the Wall. If you're looking for good new R&B check out Ashanti instead."
A brilliant book of true lives. Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end.
It is a birthday present for my granddaughter and has not been opened yet. It appears to be as promised and both girls will benefit from it.
Although this pocketbook is helpful for beginners it has one big mistake: phrases and words are written in Amharic letters (which is a good thing) but the authors were really careless when they proofread the book. In many cases the word (or phrase) written in Amharic does not correspond to it's English translation ... which leads to misunderstandings as soon as one uses the book for nonverbal communication (and that was the idea behind the usage of amharic letters)!
"I first heard this cd in a stretching class at my gym and I had to ask the instructor who was the wonderful singer ! Her voice will put you in relaxed mood, soothe your soul and remind you that life is beautiful after all. I wanted to fall in love all over again. Some of my favorites ( almost the entire selection is pretty good, anyway, with the exception of the last track) : It's crazy, I love you for sentimental reasons and Girl Talk."
"The other reviews cover the show well so I won't go into that, but I do want to warn you that the DVD case is really cheap, with the DVDs doubled up in the same slot. For the sake of 10 cents cost to them, they have produced something that is very likely to scratch your DVDs."
"It is simply not worth wasting your money even on songs of the sixties so fine as these, since the sound qualities of this disc are so poor as to completely ruin the listening experience. I used to have this on vinyl lp and should have kept it. The sound was great back then. The CD is nothing but scratches and hisses. Disgraceful."
"Currently, the movie start with Barbara and her brother enroute to the graveyard. However years ago, the movie started with the introduction of the first, the one zombie walking through the graveyard. He was introduced as the murderer of a little girl and it showed his trial, execution and then him rising from his coffin killing the burial detail before he heads in Barbara's direction. I don't know why they edited this part out. It gave the movie a little more substance., ,"
"I love Musiq ( even when he had the Soulchild, don't get me wrong all the songs aren't hits BUT for the most part he is doing his thing on this album. Cut my man a break, he is trying and I look forward to his new album. I love his voice, his music and him in general. The tracks that are my fav's are:InfatueightiesWhoknowsFortheNightYouknowyoulovemeMomentinlifeWomanopolyBuy, borrow(from a friend or Library) this Cd it's mellow like the way Neo-soul is supposed to be.Toodles,"
"I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela's."
"This movie proves that Hell is full and the dead are walking the Earth, making these movies and sitting in theatres watching them. The old ""all men are scum until they get in touch with their feelings"" plot is dredged up again in this lamebrain film. I guess I was supposed to get all doe-eyed and say ""Is'nt Mel dreamy?"" and laugh at the supposed ""Comedy"" while watching this flick, but it made me wretch! Boring, silly and a waste of time.What do men want? Our money back!"
I use this book because I am under a doctor's care and have to track my food intake and exercise daily. I'm also supposed to take notes on how I feel physically each day. I was happy to find a book that included everything I needed. It's the first one I've found and I've been doing this for a while. I also write my medications down on the journal page after I take them and have them all listed in the front. That way in case of emergency the crew would know what I take. I carry this book in my purse and love it.
The novel is a wrenching page-turner about a woman's loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live. The author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead woman's friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved. It is the best book I have read all year!
"If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn't their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else."
"The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him 19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A 19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived, poorly written, and lacking any redeeming quality. Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set."
"There's nothing bad to say about this book! Everyone should read it before they die. Great, entertaining book for anyone."
"Anyone who hasn't read about Hari Seldon and Psychohistory needs to. Though it's a fictional science in the book, I wouldn't be suprised if someone wasn't studying it today. Asimov's writing is compelling ... not too full of sci-fi babble which often sounds odd to readers 40 years later, and that makes it pretty timeless. Many older books constantly irritate me in this manner."
"Listen up all you people who think you know swing. This ain't nothin'! This isn't swing, this is something I don't know with a name attached to it. You want some REAL swing try the classics, the real thing, like Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, listen to them! the real thing! This is just a modern excuse for music."
"Very good CD, it makes me think about everything and its good when your working or when your sleeping. It have one or two ""bad"" songs but the rest are top quality. ""My Weekness"" always makes me think and put me in good mud. And if you enjoy the essays of Moby, then you'll love it! I advice you to buy it..."
"This face wash is great, it's light, foaming, and again, in the first 24 hours of using the exuviance products, there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture and overall look. It's amazing! My Proactive is going away, and I'm all over this stuff now."
"Smith has shown once again that he can only play one role - that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone's nerves. Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now. The special effects were good, but the acting was not. Chi McBride was great, and Bridget Moynihan did well, but Smith just reinforced the fact that he can't handle any role that doesn't exactly reflect his own personality and demeanor. I hope that some director in the future tries to cast Smith in a role that wasn't written for him - then we will all see that he really can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.Don't buy this on DVD - wait for it to come out on one of the cable movie channels..."
"Please come out with a DVD version of this masterpiece as soon as possible. I saw this movie many years ago, and never thought I'd see it again. If it had not been for all your reviews, I would not have known it was this movie. Yes, this is the ultimate 'primitive' movie...definitely much better than 'Clan of the Cave Bears'. Here are the things you'll see : hairy cavemen, cannibals, neanderthals, sabre-tooth tigers, mammoths, pigmies, great landscapes and sceneries. The movie will humble you and make you think how precious the most basic necessities of life really is. You'll experience love, sex, tribal wars, sadness, humor. And for the last time, forget the historical experts that always claim some movie is bad because its historically inaccurate. I won't trade this movie for 99% of the Hollywood movies out there today!"
The plastic mounting device that secures the leather flip cover to the M5 is very poorly engineered. I purchased my M5 in January and this mounting device has already broken. I am seriously considering replacing it with some other protective device.
"I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad, and the remake is worse if that were possible. In a fit of weakness I put the tape in the machine and let it play. I kept thinking, this can't get any worse and then it did. <repeat> And then thank god it was over.If I could sue for the return of my 2hrs of veiwing time I would."
The acting is fantastic. Direction outstanding. Chilling in every sense of the word. I love this movie! One of my top ten.
"this song is about lyrics, lyrics, lyrics. and leigh nash's beautiful vocals.i loved the bounce movie, but this song is more beautiful. actually, its one of our ""songs"" for my boyfriend and I. i think it should have recieved radio play, but i don't think it did. my favorite version of this song is the movie mix, which is more like and extended version. the only song i did not like is walking with strangers which is not sung by leigh nash. i just did not connect with it at all.need to be next to you is a good song for all you hopeless romantic types. the music video is really cool, it has images from the movie, which enhances what i just said about being a hopless romantic.. so with that being said i give 4 out of 5"
"I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless."
"TIMOTHY BOTTOMS WAS SO CUTE IN 1973 AND ALL THOSE SHOWER SCENES AND THE 2-3 SWIMMING POOL SCENES. AS OF AUG 2010 THIS MOVIE IS JUST A BIT OF NOSTALGIA, NOT WORTH THE 1:51 LENGTH. SURE GLAD I RENTED VS PURCHASED. RECENTLY I TRIED TO WATCH THE :STRAWBERRY STATEMENT: AND IT WAS SO DATED AND LONG I HAD TO BAIL ON IT. WE WERE INNOCENT AND NAIVE TO BUY INTO THESE FILMS WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED. VERY PREDICTABLE AND FORMULAIC. IMAGINE US COOL KIDS BUYING INTO THE FLIMSY FILMS LIKE THE PAPER CHASE, LOVE STORY, ROMEO AND JULIET, AD NAUSEUM."
thanks for nothing. I sent this product to Qatar. now some random guy in Vegas has a new prisma color art set for free. and there is no way I can contact anyone. $230 right Out the window.
"After finally finishing this book, I am very surprised that it won a prize. The first several hundred pages have the main character (Nick Guest) doing little more than having sex, fantasizing about having sex with every other male character (major or minor), or wondering if anyone else can guess that he's fantasizing about sex.Perhaps it would be a better read for someone British, because I found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the British aristocracy. The character development felt very heavy-handed and repetitive, as one scene after another depicted Nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation.The end of the book was much more rewarding, as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away. I also enjoyed some clever Henry James references. Still, I don't think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall."
"Ok, so Windows XP might be a bit advanced for such an inexpensive camera, but I wanted a very basic webcam I could talk to my significant other with for a few months while we're apart. This camera didn't come with drivers for Windows XP. I went to the website and downloaded what they said were the XP drivers, but still couldn't get it to work. I had my partner try to get it to work on my computer, he couldn't get it to work, and he's a computer guy! I finally sent it back and my brother-in-law and partner told me to go for the Logitech. I gave this one star because it didn't work for me...it might work perfectly well on all other OS's, but not on XP."
"All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction."
Thank you for a textbook that was clean and in excellent condition!
"Ok this is Dream Street...what more can i say? they are great and have amazing voices! This cd is awesome and the movie is too! The songs are catchy and u can tell there is a major voice change compared to their first cd. Also the song, With All My Heart, gets to me every time i listen to it its such a great song...one of their BEST! ok so anyways all i'm saying even though its been forever since the CD came out and since the Dream Street brake up that doesnt mean that you still can't support them...so hurry up and get the CD cuz there really isnt that many copies left, well the last time i checked there wasn't...ok thats all i gotta say."
"When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a ""true warrior"". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book."
"Waechetersbach (pronounced Veck ters bahk) dinner plates have got to be the most vibrant,colorful along with festive and great quality plates I have ever purchased. I bought the ""Coupe"" style in Kiwi. The ""Rimmed"" style seemed to be a brighter lime green color. The coupe style had a bit darker of a hue but I still think they are fabulos. Amazon had the plates at my door in a week. For more colors try Waechtersbach warehouse, or Waechtersbach usa.They are a bit on the expensive side... about 12$ per plate, but so well worth it. :)Also: NOT microwavable (it will crack the colors on the ceramic) but dishwasher safe."
i think that this book was very diffent. and that it was very hard to understand. most of the book i wasnt really sure what was going on just that he was magical and that he was in the past. there was definitly a twisted ending but thats ok. if i had a choice i probably wouldnt have read this book and read a different book on the list but oh well i got the pages i needed out of it.
"Stuart Little is one of those nice films that you can drag out on a rainy winters' day, and the kids will watch it despite having seen it lots of times before. The blu-ray quality is very good, and there is nothing in this film which will disturb young children - mine are 5 and 8 and they both enjoy it. Recommended!"
"I have to say I haven't actually read this book, but I feel like if you are considering giving this author a chance to influence your eternal salvation, you ought to give the nice people who come knocking at your door a chance too. Then pray about what you have learned and decide for yourself. But if you want to celebrate over Choco Tacos, you would have to go to Taco Johns, I used to work there and they are the ones who sell the tasty treat. (see other reviews for this book to understand what I am talking about!)"
"The jokes in this book are not only unfunny, they are not worthy of actually being called jokes. I have flipped through many of the pages in search of a good laugh and haven't found anything remotely close. I rarely post reviews. Out of curiosity I looked up this book on Amazon and saw someone posted 5 stars.This person is clinically insane.I am _that_ driven to post just to bring the average rating down. You will get more laughs with your seven dollars by renting Les Miserables."
"I loved the cover when I saw it, and I was very excited to receive it. I like this artists music, but was not too thrilled with this CD. It was not what I thought it would be, and very ""jungle like"""
Works great for repairing soles that start to come apart. It is very durable and extends the life of shoes that need minor repairs. Highly Recommend
"In Disney's ""The Rescuers Down Under,"" Rescue Aid Society mice Bernard and Miss Bianca travel to Australia to help Mara Houte, the golden eagle. With the assistance of Wilbur, an albatross, and numerous other friends encountered along the way (such as a wise-cracking kangaroo rat), they hurry to help the endangered bird. Voice talents of Bob Newhart (Bernard), Eva Gabor (Miss Bianca) and John Candy (Wilbur) move the story along at a good pace. George C. Scott provides voice for the villain, a bounty hunter of endangered animals. Scott's sidekick is a goanna lizard called Joana - and there is some fascinating interplay between the lizard and the man. A sidebar plot is Bernard's plan to propose marriage to Miss Bianca ... and all of the things that conspire to get in the way. This is a nice movie for the entire family, and one with a good message. I highly recommend it."
"To be able to go through the entire Bible, verse by verse, chapter by chapter, book by book with such an amazing Bible teacher is such a blessing. Pastor Chuck clearly teaches topical lessons we can learn in the Bible, which were put there for us by God!"
"harry potter movies 1 and 2 and 3 are excelent.they cut, obviously, but the story was still a clear, presise message. then along comes a yodelin', rough backin' coyote to change everything the way he sees fit. heres just some of the loose ends left untied.why did neville go nuts by the cruciatus?how did crouch live, escape, attack moody,who killed crouch? where did the house elves go, when is fudge gonna call dumbledore mad? what about rita skeeter? or spew? and theres hardly any snape!at least the actors were good. daniel radcliffe, EMMA WATSON ,and rupert. but the director must think that because they call it harry potter, it cant be about any one else. i quote: 'harry potter and the goblet of fire is about HARRY POTTER, and THE GOBLET OF FIRE. PERIOD!'"
CLAY AIKENS NEW CD IS WONDERFUL BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECITED HIS VOICE LIFT'S MY SPIRIT'S UP I AM A DIE HEART ELVIS FAN JUST WATING FOR SOME ONE TO LIKE AS MUCH I THINK I HAVE FOUND HIM
"I thought this video was very good. I haven't seen other versions, so I can't compare them, but I think it portrays the book excellently (although the book IS of course, better). The first tape is the best. Daniel Radcliffe does a wonderful job playing young David. The plot also follows the book and even the lines in the book very well. The character are cast perfectly. Mr. Murdstone is horrible, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber are exactly how they are in the book! In the second tape, I wish they hadn't cut out the part with the old Doctor, or Tommy Traddles. They focused more on his relationship with Dora and Agnes in the movie, whereas there are many themes going on at once in the book. Also some little things, like Agnes doesn't seem to take quite so kindly to Dora in the movie as she does in the book. But Maggie Smith is excellent as Betsy Trotwood (of course). Overall, this is a fabulous movie. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll want to after you see this."
I painfully read the entire book just to see if something exciting would happen up to the very end of the book. It didn't.
"Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it, especially after attending the Idol concert in Raleigh. Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers. There is also no diversity. Most of the songs sound the same to me. As an older fan I was hoping for some classic numbers like those Clay sang on the TV series. I won't be listening to this CD again. Hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let Clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next CD."
It was a wonderful biography of Marie Curie and very interesting but there were times I got lost in all the technology and chemistry of it. I would rate it a 4 1/2 but the stars above wouldn't let me rate it that way. What an amazing woman and what amazing accomplishments and contributions she made especially in that time.
There is only one good song on this whole album...don't waste your money unless you are super religious-then maybe you can relate to this music.
"I thought this would be a cool laminator to have for my club. Boy was I wrong. My documents were wrinkly. I even ran the documents through a few times. The last time, it ate the carrier. The binder part wasn't very good either. You have to use special folders. I can't believe the manufacturer intended this for the office when it can't even support my little club's laminating needs. It goes to show a good looking product doesn't necessarily delivers."
"Talk about amazing. These girls are definetely worth listening to. A couple months ago my friend talked me into downloading one of their songs. I caved in and did so. I listened to just a little clip of them, and I was immediately hooked. These girls have amazing voices, and you can definetely tell their heart and souls are in their music. I also think it's awesome that they are open about their sexuality. These girls aren't ashamed, and I believe that's awesome! These girls have awesome tracks like ""All the things she said"" a nice cover of ""How soon is now"", and one of my favs ""Malchik Gay"". If you feel like putting yourself in a good mood, and feel like dancing, then I definetely recommend this CD! Get them now, it's well worth it!"
I didn't get to review the book I was looking for before I got sent to sign up as a new customer to Amazon. I don't know how to get back to the info on the book from this link to review it before rating it. Sorry.
This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.
The warmer works just fine at keeping coffee warm. The switch on the body of the unit is easy to locate (as opposed to one on the cord). The one downside is that it is too small to hold a very large mug. I guess it just holds the standard size.
"This album, is so full of phony music, ""Lauren, honey you dissappointed me, I guess I'll stick to the Fugees, rather than on your solo"" This album has no real freshness, it all sounds the same, all the songs are of about the same beat, there is nothing that lift my soul to even want to sing along with her lyrics, the only one is that last song, in the album, which is an oldie just revised to a new version. I really thought she could have done a lot better especially with winning all those grammy's."
"One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD."
Rarely have so many cliches about the South been found in one single place. The black lady with 7 children all with Ph.D.'s was too much for me! Her sexually adventurous 8th child was more believable.
"I remember being about 10 or 11 years old and being frightened out of my mind by the scary Bjork lady dancing around on a truck on MTV. Sufficet to say, I couldn't understand why she was getting rave reviews. A coupla years later I saw her on Jay Leno singing a big-band song and loved it. The screaming was a little odd for me, but I recanted and bought the single to ""It's Oh So Quiet."" Can you say, ""Excellent""? I immediately went out and purchased this CD, ""Post"" and was blown away at how awesome it is! There are so many good songs on here, it is definitley a CD everyone should own. Don't miss it! And by the way, Bjork being scary just makes her oh so much more appealing, wouldn't you say?"
"I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell, But I was sadly mistaken when I got halfway through it and I kept hitting glich after glich. I thought it was my Xbox, but I took it to a friend's and glich after glich. I guess I got the worst game in history, but that's what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one"
"I have rated the ""DVD"" the lowest possible rating, although I would give the movie the highest rating. Who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox? With the advent of DVD's, there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all it's New York glory. I absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued, remastered and includes some serious extras. This is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time."
"This book was jam-packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue. At 236 very small pages with a bigger font than necessary, this novel was probably more like 150 real pages long. It also seemed to be written for, oh, I don't know - a ten year old maybe. The writing seemed to be geared to a fourth grade level. All I can hope for now is that it doesn't get made into a load-of-crap TV movie."
This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
This did not have a fruity smell at all and had to be thrown out because it is definatley not something I would ever wear again.
Have been using Exuviance products for many years they are the best. Its too bad they are not widely known. Everyone would look a lot younger!!! Exuviance should be advertising their products.
"It works. That's the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places, exposing wire after only a month. My phone is telling me that I am using an unauthorized charger. So no, this was not a good purchase, and I do not trust the source."
"It's interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit, when they now tour with bands like that. Its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alterna-metal band's, except without what little talent or melody those bands possess. This band has as much to do with hardcore as Sepultura. I thought this was a joke band when I heard it. f you're really interested in hardcore, put down that jug of Weight Gainer 900, turn off your victory sampler CD, and order a Universal Order of Armadgeddon CD immediately. And stop wearing so much adidas, newjack."
"This movie should have never been made, there is basically no story present and is just a bunch of people going around on rollerblades bashing each other's brains in. I was really looking foreword to this flick, it's previews were misleading, it looked as though it was brilliant and exciting. Guess what, it's really really really NOT!Trust me don't waste your time unless the only thing better you have to do is give the cat a bath, even then I really don't believe you should waste your time!"
"I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."

"Don't even remember watching it, could not have been very good! Whoever created this should find another career. Best of luck!"
It was a gift for my nephew for Christmas. It came in great shape and even included a comic book!
"I really liked this book and I love the main character of Tempe Brennan. The characters are well drawn and multi-dimensional and I loved all of the tidbits about forensics and anthropology. The locations were rich in detail and I felt like I was there. My only complaint about this book was that I had every single plot point figured out a good 30-50 pages before Tempe did. There wasn't a single thing in this book that surprised me. But it was still an enjoyable read and even if I knew that going in, I would still read it."
"Once again,McDermott's verbal mastery takes you to the place of which she writes as clearly as if looking through a window on the scenes she describes so vividly. However, compared to ""Charming Billy"", this piece is disappointing. While very well written descriptively, I found it slow. The opening act caught my attention and I continued to read hoping for more of the same alure...it was not to be found. I actually skipped paragaphs and entire pages and was able to continue as if the skipped parts were of no importance to the story at all. While I would recommend Ms. McDermott's work, I would not recommend this particular book."
"Guy Durham masterfully tells a spy tale with grity details of the processes along the way. He includes a myriad of interesting characters and plot twists in a live-action way, Bravo!"
"Gracias a este libro recien llegamos a descubrir que toda la humanidad habito en algun momento en Macondo. Olvidensen de las grandes civilizaciones del pasado, este pueblo perdido lo abarca todo, amor, odio, guerras. Y los Buendia son como cualquier ser humano de este planeta. Esta novela son de las que se leen de un tiron, no importa que afuera pase un viento huracanado como el que destruye al pueblo al final. Al cerrar la ultima pagina todos llevamos algo de Macondo dentro de nosotros."
"There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the ""too good to be true"" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier."
"I just love this cd. After I got the cd I must have played it over and over for days. There is not a song that isn't great! Everything is sung with such heart! I think Clay Aiken is the best thing to happen to pop music in a long time. No gimmicks, just pure talent!"
"These other reviewers are kidding you.There are significant problems with this dvd.1. The audio on this dvd is horrible. It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube. I could have done better in my garage.2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin. There is no teaching whatsoever.I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this."
"french rap at its best! i love it, great beats, excellent lyrics, dope features, every euro worth ;-))"
"Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore ""The Hobbit."" My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child, and I've read the book countless times since then. Given my long commute currently, I've become a big fan of audiobooks. I picked this up with high hopes.What a let down. The audiobook is abridged, although the package didn't note that anywhere, the abridgement choices are odd at best (leave in Beorn but take out almost everything of Rivendell?), the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible (I want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges) and to top it all off, the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent...."
"Can't go wrong with the content. Amazing acting, photography, storyline. Only complaint is a couple of minutes of slightly blurry picture on one of the discs. So glad to own this for my viewing whenever I want."
I HAD TO RETURN MINE DUE TO INACCURATE DESCRIPTION6.2 IS UNREADABLE FOR ME
"Grab a teen and watch it with them if you've got one around.Saw it awhile ago, wasn't that impressed. Teenaged Daughter wanted to watch it, so I sat with her and enjoyed it more this time.Thought provoking, and a conversation starter."
"Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this film. Some people praise it like it's as good as Taxi Driver. After watching it though, I have no clue what people see in this movie. It drags on and on and at some points of the film (espcially the middle) you really have no idea what is going on anymore. I almost felt like shutting it off a few times, but luckily De Niro's acting kept me from hitting the stop button.I'm sure when this movie came out it was shocking and disturbing, since there wasn't much like it back then. However, by today's standards it really falls flat on it's face. I would not recommend this film to anyone, although if you're really curious about it feel free to give it a try. Obviously there are those who like really bizarre pointless movies like this. Just don't say I didn't warn you!"
"For such a little book, it is quite informative.I bought a copy when it was first published around 10 years ago & found myself reading & referring to it many many times. I've had an interest in Vodou for many years & like some that didn't grow up in Haiti or anyplace where Vodou is present, ""The Book Of Vodou"" is a great introduction.This book's is a very appealing glimpse into a beautiful religion that is often misunderstood. It has great photographs throughout & is straight & to the point about the origins & history of Vodou from West Africa all the way up to the present day without information overload.I have been a practioner of ""The Arts"" for many years, as well as a historian & there's not one negative thing I can say about this book. It's one of my favourite books on Vodou & in fact, I'm on my fourth copy!If you any interest in Vodou, start with this book! You will not be disappointed."
"I am a fan of the ""Haloween"" series of films but have never seen part III (due to eveyone I know saying its terrible). After all these years I wanted to give it an objective chance and was excited to actually watch this film. Please note going into this film I knew Michael Myers has nothing to do with it and was just fine with that. Well - This film is terrible by any standard. I would classify this film more as Sci-Fi and what a far-fetched (even by Sci-Fi standards) plot this was. Sloppy story-line that doesn't flow, horrible acting and the movie moves slow without much suspense. The only question you will ask is ""how much longer is this movie"" after the first 1/2 hour.I love the idea behind doing something different with the movie besides Michael Myers but this one misses badly which is probably why it went back to the Michael Myers theme. Too bad.Believe the negitive reviews you have heard and don't waste your time!"
"Book is highly boring as restates the same thing over and over. There is barely any thrilling action and the dog reads more like a background character than the main one. The book makes me sleep as the lewis and clark story is the most boring of all american history events. And this is of all the crap that is american history. Because they are just so boring. OMG they are traveling west, wow, do I give a ****. Plus just because your american and the story is american doesn't make it great you mother*******. **** you. Hope the book rots in hell."
"""Of Mice and Men""In this story there are two very good friends, George and Lennie. They are on a journey for a better life. Lennie is mentally ill so George teaches him right from wrong on the way. They are leaving a little town and going to another town in search of a better job. Several of Lennie's habits get then fired from their last job so they hope that they will have better luck in the next one. Lennie makes quite a few mistakes but no matter what George manages to over look them until Lennie makes a very big mistake which leads to a SHOCKING ending."
"I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II: The Sequel. The first one was great, and I'd watch it over and over again. But since I've seen the sequel, it hasn't been as funny. The sequel's pretty unoriginal and the replayed humor detracts from its predessor it's the same love story, and a smattering of redone scenes. (Rember the old woman who hung herself?) I wouldn't buy this one. In fact, I wouldn't even spend the money to rent it on DVD; save yourself a few bucks, rent it on VHS."
It was a bit more pinkish-red than I had thought (the lava and the liquid) but it's still pretty and enjoyable.
"I've read many reviews on this site -- some negative, some positive. I have A LOT of hair. My hair is full of texture. My hair doesn't grow down (length), it grows out (wide.) I WOULD NEVER USE A HAIR DRYER BEFORE! I couldn't unless I wanted to look like a clown. This product is the first product that allows me to dry my hair. The product does get very hot! That is what my hair needs to become straight and manageable, however. If you don't have frizzy and unruly hair, this is product was NOT made for you. I, however, must say FINALLY!!"
"This book presents a marian version of the traditional Greek orthodox Jesus prayer. Instead of ""Lord Jesus Christ, son of the living God, have mercy on me a sinner"", Sister reveals that Jesus has told her to constantly repeat the phrase ""Jesus, Mary, I love you. Save souls."" While on the surface the prayer is very simple, it is difficult in practice because of the requirements of purity of mind, intense desire, and continuous repetition. Sister says that Jesus finds the prayer most pleasing, of great benefit to all souls, living and deceased, and with the help of grace, can be done by anyone. This is a method of prayer for the ""littlest ones"" of all ages."
"Alan Moore's work is among the most influential in the comics field. This essay, which is bound in a comic-style format, is short but gets the creative juices going. He shares some useful insight into storycraft and framing plots for the comics medium. I do not write comics (prose fiction is my area), but I dound this insightful and inspiring. If you like his work in Watchmen and Swamp Thing, this is definitely worth picking up. And it is very, very cheap."
"I bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever! The smell of urine seeps through the diapers. Also, they do not absorb at all...not worth the savings!"
"The celebration of Duke Ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and, thankfully, some fine reissues of his work. This CD takes a more contemporary approach to Ellington's music resulting in a sort of smooth jazz sampler of the Duke. It's a very entertaining approach with some stellar work by an all-star roster of artists. Well worth a listen."
this book has been great it brings a lot of emotions and it's cool to see different types of people caring for each other and having a real great friendship until the end........
So far very good set. Wish they had more that were the same size in the set but the quality of the cords has been very good
"This film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made. It outshines the 2001 original. The action, special effects, acting, story, and the villain are all improved. The action is this film is heart pumping, non stop, and fun to watch. The special effects have greatly improved over the past three years, especially in the aerial shots of New York City. The acting in the film is better especially in Mary Jane's character. The story is definately improved, due to the emphasis on Harry Osborne's hate of Spiderman, and Peter Parker having to juggle his life around being a superhero. Another great aspect of this film is the new villain, Doc. Oc. This villain you can hate and sympathize with unlike the totally sinister green goblin. The film's ending sets up perfectly for a third installment to this wonderful film series that will last for generations."
The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.
"Its ok for a single DVD. However, if you are looking for an extended documentary on his life, buy the big 4 or 5 DVD volume by Ken Burns, there's nothing like it, and it spends quite a lot of time on Bird. Its a must-have for jazz fans."
"I watched The Velvet rope tour on HBO and it was the bomb, it was the greatest tour that I have ever seen, everything was choreographed pefectly, the music was slammin and Janet really communicated with her fans. When she sang ""I get Lonely"", ""Nasty"" and ""You"", it sent me Crazy. I love you Janet!"
"I love this c.d. Nine Days are absolutely great. They have depth and meaning to all their songs and though some people have said that all the songs sound alike, I disagree. So anway, basically like my title says, it's a great c.d."
This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
"This is by far the most informative book I have come across for lettering and coloring comics. it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art, prep it in photoshop, color it, letter it and finally the clean up process. heck, it even goes into how to submit it to the publisher. it also gives non step by step info on things such as color theory and the use of photoshop filters. WAY better than any Marvel book i've read so far."
I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics.
"The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually, this song blows after you hear it more than 5 times. This cd has only been in my cd player once...That is the day i bought it. If you like wasting money, buy this cd."
"This was much bigger then I had anticipated, that being my own fault. But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable. So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated! Not one bit pleased with this product."
"This Born Free sequel lacks authenticity (the two leads show a loving relationship, when the opposite is well-known) and credibility (how in the world could the three young cubs shown have survived on their own for as long as they supposedly did?). It's also boring."
"Is anyone else having issues with these discs? When you first place the discs in the player, it skips over the main menus. Then the ""menu"" button will only start and stop the episode selected, but it will not return you to the main menu. There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned ""off."" The only way to avoid this is to choose ""other"" subtitles with the remote. This appears to be an authoring issue, as I am using a two year-old Sony Dream System DVD player and have not had these issues with previous seasons. I'm exchanging my discs immediately, but I have a feeling they might all be bad. Anyone else hear about these issues?"
At least with the old type you could hook a water hose to the outlet side and attach a sprinkler to it and not have to drag a hose up and down your garden roes knocking plants
"Don't get me wrong, Clay is a wonderful vocalist. Really, truely, he is a gifted singer. But the big problem these days is that there are so many gifted singers who end up with horrible, stale, and downright creepy material. Has anyone actually listened to the lyrics to ""Invisible""? It sounds more like a stalker than a lonely everyman, and it's way creepy. His other songs all sound the same, and in some cases are laughably silly. I feel so let down. I wanted so much to love this album, because I love Clay, but it's just bad. Hopefully next time around Clay gets himself more worthy material, because if he continues down this path, he will end up forgotten. Please! Better material!"
"I've been a DMB fan for quite a while now and have always loved their music, but hearing this CD just made me like the songs even more! I didn't really enjoy bluegrass before hearing this CD, but after hearing this album the only thing I can listen to is this Tribute! This is the best tribute I've ever heard! Every song is done in a way that adds more to the original version with every strum and pick! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Dave Matthews Band, or just bluegrass in general! If you don't believe me then listen to the samples! No matter how long you listen to this Breathe 2: Tribute to DMB you'll understand what I mean, and know that when you stop you'll be thiving for more! This song will become an addiction after you hear it! Do yourself a favor and buy Breathe 2! Trust me on this one, you won't be dissapointed!"
"be careful, when using this. This is super thin. It will break if your gf is not wet enough.warning!"
"I fell in love with him when he first auditioned on American Idol 2. I was praying for him the whole way through and was disappointed when he lost to Ruben. But his sales prove that he should have been the American Idol. I bought his CD the second day it came out, I had been waiting for it for so long and I was not disappointed at all. He sounds wonderful and it feels as if he's singing only to you. If you have a good ear and know good music when you hear it, this CD is for you!! There aren't many good singers left so I'm thankful he's blessed with this gift."
Gives a great overall view of this modern type career for both men and women. Provides the nuts and bolts of the career.
"As a 27 year old man from the UK, I was stunned by how this record took me back to bike rides along the beach in a simpler time (which was quite frankly, before my time). I love it and hope you do too.Thanks, OC."
One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.
"This movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath. Once just wasn't enough in the theater. I just had to see it again on the big screen. I never used to be into movies with subtitles. But the effect just isn't the same as it is in its native tongue. Just when I thought it's over, it just takes you on another turn and another and another!!! If you like fast paced, unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove, this one's for you."
"Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap."
"Helmut Rilling does well with large scale works of Bach, which is a plus on the B Minor Mass. Everything is well articulated, with solid bass lines (often lacking in ""authentic"" performances). He captures the faith aspect very well. His ""crucifixus"" is the best I have heard in capturing the pain of the cross, followed by the brilliant contrast of ""et resurrexit"". He has an excellent cast of soloists. It flows well, but has a very slight feel of heavy-footedness. It has none of the dance quality so prominent in the Mauersberger recording (Rudolf Mauersberger one of few who can bring out both dance and devotion). Overall, most people who are not too much into ""Historically Informed"" would find this quite satisfying."
"Although Berry's bad guys are pretty unconflicted about being bad guys (especially for priests) and the reveal regarding the third secret of Fatima is jarring more for its anachronistic feel than for its content, this yarn is similar to Dan Brown's Angels and Demons in its look at the inner workings of papal enclaves and backstage Vatican politicking. It starts just a bit slow, but has a satisfying build-up of suspense and twists so as to make it a reasonable page-turner for those who won't get too hung up on the undertone of criticism for the current Catholic church and its various doctrines. While there are some odd character choices and a bit of inconsitency about how urgent various things are and aren't along the way, I found myself entertained and turning pages and, after all, isn't that really the point of a mass market thriller? Donald J. Bingle, Author ofForced Conversion."
"Ever since their emergence on Paul Simon's Graceland, the unique harmonies and rhythms have kept me enthtralled. The notable thing about this CD is how their famous guests adapt to their sound, choice of material, and blend is solid. Some collaborations work better than others. Mellissa Ethridge and Natalie Merchant are two standouts. This a worthwhile introduction this group."
"My son who is going to be 2 soon simple loves this float. He hates getting into our bath tub and used to cry a lot. So when i came across this float on Amazon i wondered if it will ever be used, but just gave it a shot and Lo and Behold...... it was magic!!!! my son sits in it in the pool and keeps singing to himself. This float is pretty sturdy and doesnt topple. And the netted area between the 2 concentric tubes makes it all the more fun as the water becomes reachable for the kid to play and splash but at the same time keeping him safe :) He is hyper active when inside the pool, jumping crazy and stuff but still the float stands sturdy!!! The air seems to go out if not used for 2-3 days, donno if its common or not, but i have a balloon pump that comes in handy. i recommend to parents who want their kids to like water :)"
"This book, first and foremost, brings to life the pure beauty of Britain; the old houses, wildlife and its rather bizarre history and has made me very proud of where I come from.The Other Boleyn Girl is extremely readable and tells of the rise and fall of the Boleyn family. I have never been much of a person for history but this book certainly interested me and went beyond anything I could have learnt in history class.I recommend this book without really saying why (for fear of ruining parts) but coming from a history know nothing I say it is definitely worth a read if you want to know about the greed of one man and the unstoppable ambition of one tragic family."
"The content - introductory notes, translation - is great. This is one of my favourite adaptations of the Canterbury Tales into modern English.The Kindle version, however, complete ruins the book. The printed version presents facing-page translation, which works great. The kindle version attempts to do that, having one 'page' after the other, not considering that due to the font-size adaptability, this doesn't work at all."
"EVERYTHING ABOUT ALBUM MAKES ME WANNA GRAB A GUN AND SHOOT MYSELF. THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS. IT'S LACKS EMOTION, AND IT SOUNDS FORCED. LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO HARD TO SPREAD THE WORD INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE GOOD MUSIC. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD IS SO GENERIC, SO DULL, SO PREDICTABLE. ONLY A MORON WOULD THINK THIS IS A WORTH WHILE CD TO LISTEN TOO."
"As other reviewers have suggested, this book is FULL of errors. I used this book (along with the official guide and the REA book which is much better) for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless. There are so many errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that I didn't already know to be accurate. Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide. Many of the mistakes are obvious, but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error.This book is not worth the time."
"This product tho it seemed to match our current one, failed to synchronize with our garage door opener. It didn't work at all. A waste"
"This book redefines derriviative. It seems like the sort of fan fiction where the writer goes in to other writers' worlds, kills their dragons, steals their gold, and makes out with their Arwen. This book makes a fine door-stop or paperweight, though (+1 star)."
"My english teacher read this book outloud to us. It was the worst thing ever. I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring! It seemed like it took forever to finish so dont read this book unless you want somthing really, really boring!"
The video kept timing out. The screen would go black or multi color. I had to wait for the movie to restart every 10 minutes
"If you read it through and through, you will find how wonderful it is to approach calculus in a graphical, numerical and symbolic way. If you want to challenge your mind in this way, this book is probably the most suitable for you. I am using it in my calculus calss, and I found the concepts are very clearly explained. The thing that I love most of this book is that it helps students develop a good understanding of calculus through observing and studying the graphs of the functions. This only imperfection of the book, if any, is that there lack of some theoretical exercises. But any book can not be perfect. The most important thing is how you enjoy it. For me, it is a new and fresh guide of the study of calculus."
I recently purchased the eMarker by Sony. It shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be. It looks great attached to my keyring. Needless to say with it's sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention. The main problem is its lack of extremely useful features. I hope Sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.
"By and large, the movie fails because it strays too far from the premise of the TV show and ventures into 007 and Bourne territory.No IMF team, no suspense, poor story.The TV series is far superior."
"I bought the Drawing & Painting Fantasy Beasts and the Fantasy Figures books for our high school library. The kids really enjoy them and so do I. I just signed on to see what else might be in this series and to order more copies. While these books may not appeal to everyone (not enough step-by-step for true beginners), the layout and abundance of good pictures and ideas will grab most readers and artists."
This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
"Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown. He writes with a sharp knife about poverty, hunger, cruel management and lack of compassion. Humor here is on the grim side."
"I train pharmacy technicians, and this is the best, most concise review book I have seen. Almost everything on the test is covered here."
"Great video. My son cant get enough of this. Any child or adult who loves trains will enjoy this DVD,"
"Don't listen to that negative, uncalled-for review by F.Faulkner ""F.F."" He doesn't know what he is talking about. He just came to stir up trouble because he is jealous, rude, and ignorant. Let me clean up this board. Clay Aiken's voice is outstanding and is like no other. ""Measure Of A Man"" CD is exciting and is the best debut CD by a male musical artist in the past 3 years. Clay Aiken is ""America's Idol"" because of his irresistable voice and character and his many, many fans. Please buy this CD. You will not be disappointed at all. The songs are very good."
"Of the 200+ baseball books I've read, ""Babe: The Legend Comes to Life"" is my favorite. Creamer wrote the book while some of the old-timers were still alive, and this makes his story come to life. If you want to learn about Babe Ruth, this is the definitive book to read."
"If you can't hold the cards, this will work but I believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box. The idea is to make it easier for the individual. It can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose. A block of wood will do better. The card holder shouldn't be a game within a game."
"I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used."
I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
"i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are, at first glance, totally wrong for each other! i mean, a centuries old vampire, and a vampire slayer? it was ironic! i also liked that even though Quin was a cold fish on the outside, inside he was just as lonely as Rashel, even if he rarely admitted it. i loved the book and couldn't put it down! if u haven't read it yet, do so!"
"Dumas is the greatest story teller ever, and this is his finest work. If you love adventure, great yarns or being captivated by excellence, read this book."
"The Special Edition model is NOT recommended!I recently purchased the Special Edition model as a replacement to my single serve Tassimo. I changed because my favorite Starbucks single serve coffee changed from the Tassimo to the Keurig. Well, after about 2-weeks of using the Keurig, I have found that the Special Edition Keurig is poorly designed. The water container is a joke, even with the larger 60 oz container. It is so oddly shaped that it is difficult to remove and impossible to replace on the unit without spilling some of the water.In addition, it seems like every cup of coffee tastes about the same. This was not the case with my old Tassimo. I have tried a few brands provided in the assortment pack and like the Starbucks coffees. However, all the Starbucks coffees taste the same and even different brand coffees all taste about the same.Very, very disappointed!"
"If you are a fan of apocalyptic fiction, there are many better books to read than this. While I did finish it, i found it slow moving (very slow), Pretentious in language, and very out of date in the effects of war. I think the real message was about the value of civil defense. An interesting point, but the author, writing in the mid-50's was talking about efftects of atomic bombings that are much milder than true. Totally unrealistic."
"I had heard many different things about Ben Franklin, one of the historical figures in the establishment of the United States. This book confirmed some things I had heard and debunked some others. Good book."
"The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately, the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe. Didn't matter which sock I wore. I had to return."
This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
"Ron's playful and probing musicality emerges in this album with the no-holds-barred clairvoyance I came to expect after he wrote and performed two film scores for me. I find him to be a certifiable, bonafide talent -- one of life's genuine little treasures secreted away in the mountains of Montana. In a way I am [selfishly] sorry to hear his album is realizing such widespread success -- I was kind of hoping to keep him all to myself."
the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that I have bought
"I like this product when using my Bosch combo kit on my router table. This base allows me to adjust the router bit height from above the router table by using the included Hex Key. In additon, I can leave this base permanently attached to the router table. I simply pull the motor out of the base that's attached to the router table and then stick it into one of the other router bases when I want to use the router freehand. Very convenient."
"Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series, this book was the explanation of who Monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory. This is a wonderful series and I would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book, ""The Face of a Stranger"" which is the first in the series, for a more complete appreciation of each following book."
The sad reality is that year after year fewer American students are going into the fields of science and the best students (and teachers) are increasingly brought in from overseas. Most recently non-citizens in the U.S. have received more Phds in the sciences and engineering than citizens.The fact that (un-)intelligent design is given a sounding board or that idiots like Phd theologians are pining on scientific theory shows how far we've fallen behind. In a generation or two moronic ID theories will vie hand in hand with New Age idiot beliefs while leadership in real science and technology migrates to Europe and Asia.Shame.
These recordings deeply affected me- even more so than the works of the Johnny Mathis.
"I read this book 10 years ago, and it has never left me since! Bilbo is an inspiration to us all! You can see yourself in his character. I have been suggesting this book to all of my friends since I read it, and each one who's read it thanked me immensly for introducing them to the world of Tolkien. Now I'm tackling the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy""...."
Great story of a teenager who spends a week in a mental health ward makes new friends and changes his life.
I really liked the cards. I teach a class in creativity and I was able to give them to individual students to encourage their creative growth.
"I previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book. And I was quite annoyed to find that some one posing to be me, Michael G from Passaic NJ, said that I was mistaken for my previous diatribe of the book. I'm not sure who it was. Obviously someone figured that I was not going to read the reviews again. I'm not sure who it was.I still maintain that the beek is BAD. It seems that some one is trying to sell this at all costs. This makes me very suspicious of all Amazon reviews. Sorry :(MG"
"Well, as this album leads from songs for the deaf, i also have to say, this is a really good album. Long slow goodbye, little sister, and in my head are really good songs, and someone's in the wolf, (another song on the album) is good. and practically every song is pretty good. I would say the worst song(s) are broken box, and you got a killer scene there man. Well, let's see what our surprise is on the next album......"
"After 4 months of trying to plow through this book, I finally gave up on page 121 and read the last page. I kept hoping things would get better; The pace would pick up and I might care about these people. To no avail. A thourough disappointment. start to abbreviated finish."
The Thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.
"This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself ""Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally"". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough, the absolute best song these guys ever put out isn't featured on either of their cd's. (Sweet Summer) Besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song, it's nothing like the first cd. Nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of Don't Stop on this cd. Just kinda BLAND soft rock. I recommend downloading Sweet Summer as it is their best song by FAR and perhaps possibly buying the first cd, but don't waste your time on this one."
"This toy is by far our favorite! I don't know how many hours total our son has spent hammering the balls and then watching them go through the maze. Sometimes he uses the hammer, sometimes he just pounds them with his hand. The hammer isn't that hard, so when he does decide to hammer Dad's head, it doesn't hurt that much :-) If your child is less than 1, it will take a few days playing with the toy before he/she masters it and pounds the balls with confidence (they LEARN the toy). If we had 1 toy to take with us on a trip, this would definitely be the one. Highly recommend."
just didn't like this book. it seem to be crude and it's really a book for girls only.
"I'll echo exactly what the previous 2 reviewers wrote, this film is amazing, unbelievable, almost beyond words. Here is a church, probably minutes away from our White House and our Congress (these who are supposed to be taking care of their neighborhood, which would be the whole, United States.) Anyway,The church is filled with people who support each other, and improve their neighborhood with knowledge, job training, peaceful demonstrations, free healthcare, and much more. The church seems to me, to be exactly what a church is meant to be."
I figured that a gas cap like this would ship with a rubber seal on the inside. It does not. Had to makeshift a rubber seal. Really a big bummer.
"First off this helmet is enormous, even in a medium. It is the right size for my head and fits ok but I might as well flip it upside down because is sits on the top of my head and doesn't really go on or around it. There is so much padding inside it that it does not even slide halfway down your head. Obviously a knock off with the materials used. I don't understand why there are so many good reviews! The chrome looks nice but it's so easily corrupted that I scratched it with my fingernails trying to get the stickers off of it. I can understand that in order for it to be DOT approved that it should include a lot of padding but the only way this helmet would be safe is if you fell straight down from the sky onto your head. I am definitely returning this helmet despite having to pay for shipping both ways. I will up my rating review if the refund goes smoothly."
"The word ""robot"" comes from the Czech word ""robota,"" which in English means ""corvee,"" the obliged labor or servitude that vassals (such as serfs or peasants) had to perform on the lords' estates."
"I've just started studying an MBA in the U.S.(I am going through my second semester), and I saw this film a couple of weeks ago. The first ten minutes did not tell me anything good, since it seemed one of those low budget, ""C"" type, uninteresting comedies that invite you to switch channel.I am glad I didn't, because we eventually had a lot of fun with the dialogs and situations, a long discussion after the film was finished, and I saw lots of things that have to do with my management courses...Very recommendable, either to de-stress, or to realize that THAT (all the bad karma and nonsense by people who just want to control you and your life) is what you want to avoid, by all means. On the job, or in everyday life..."
I like the CD. I found a real interesting way to be a part of Moby's music by mixing your own version of body rock at beatnik.com.
"I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with. However, when I contacted Pjur Customer Service, they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation. That did in fact get out the stains."
This book is great for anyone having trouble taking the asvab for the first time. My daughters score improved tremendously!
"Stone takes the reader on a fascinating journey recapping Vincent Van Gogh's life of hardships and triumphs in his biographical novel Lust for Life. Beginning in London, the author reveals Vincent's inner core as a young man of twenty-one working as a clerk for European art dealers while falling madly in love with a vivacious nineteen-year-old kindergarten teacher. Vincent's reaction to this unrequited relationship establishes a pattern of behavior and insight into his personality, which makes him more empathetic as a character. Vincent leaves London and embarks on journey in search of his ""true calling"" and ends up as a minister living in abject poverty in a Belgium miners' village. This situation strengthens his character and weakens his faith, but out of that grows a passion for art and drawing. The obsession begins and so does his real journey. This book is well worth reading."
"I love Pampers Swaddlers so I thought I'd try these once my baby outgrew the Swaddlers. While I've never had any issues with leaking, I've had to throw out at least four brand-new diapers (so far) because the the entire side where the tab tears off while I'm trying to fasten the diaper. I've never had this problem with Swaddlers or Huggies, so I know it's not the operator. Also, these diapers don't seem to fit very securely. They tend to sag and feel very cheap (even my husband commented on that and he generally doesn't notice these kinds of things). I've only used about 20 diapers from my box of 140, but I'm sure I'll have more problems with tearing. What a waste!"
"I read most every book on this subject since I am a therapist and a parent.This is a great place to start.It might not be the most readable book but, nonetheless, is worth buying."
"This was an excellent story about World War II. Three friends who share quality time at Sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the War. Harry Waever is in military intelligence for the United States. His other two friends,Jack Halder and Rachel Stern are at work for the Nazis. They are setting up a German plan to assasinate Roosevelt and Churchill in Egypt. It is up to Weaver to stop them. They are of course reunited. This excellent book has many surprises as well as manytwists and turns. The book will definitely leave you wondering what if? Be sure to read this book, you will not be dissapointed."
I had a hard time finishing this book. Not enough adventure for me. I was actually glad when I finally reached the end. I kept thinking the storyline might improve but to no avail. Definitely a disappointment.
"Yep! Santana comes back yet once more with the SAME formula: lots of big names in the music biz packed in a nice album, with him and his band playing to them. End of formula. Is the album bad? Not by any means, if you isolate it from the rest of his musical production. But if you consider this guy has been putting out significantly more original material in years past, listening to more of this Santana-guitar-sound-accompanying-some-big-name-in-the-music-business is quite dissapointing. Once more, I feel fortunate for having Napster. I wouldn't buy this album, not even for its contagious opening ""Hermes"". My advice is simple: skip it. I give it two stars for what it's worth production-wise, but nothing else."
"Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters, and it gets ever annoying to watch Gomez to be fancy and exciting doing things. It's like...Can the nightmare end? Even though it is a 101 minute flick, The Addams Family is just too long to sit through. The plot is idiotic, and the whole time, I am wondering why couldn't they have electrocuted Fester in hopes of kicking his amnesia over. I am surprised that, despite the fact that everybody in the family likes dark incidents and so so, nobody was abusing drugs. Wake me up when somebody hires Thing for a job...like he has a social security number. Did the film really start the gothic trend where stupid kids in high school were dressing up all in black and pretending to have mental and emotional problems? All in all, The Addams Family is a terrible piece of rubbish that manages to make time to crawl very slowly."
"I bought this movie new, but it will not play on my DvD player. I have tried several other players/machine to play this in & it will not work in any of them. I am very disappointed with this product. When I was looking at it on Amazon, it didn't say it was not compatable with any system."
"For those who don't want to be dragged into the new .net world. There is still asp...however, 2.0 is the old version, at least get 3.0"
We bought this toy to replace a tent that was falling apart (that our kids loved and used in the house). This one was way too small. Good for one kid only.
This DVD of a 1967 Swedish movie was just as I have remembered it when it was first released. Great photography and great background music. A most enjoyable film that can safely be viewed by all the family.
"I thought the author couldn't do worse than his job with The List of 7--how wrong I was! The 6 Messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development. Characters and situations seemed trite and confusing and the last part of the novel was a complete waste. I still believe Frost has the potential for great exciting fiction, but somehow he fails to deliver."
"Growing up in a military family makes me like the style of these books all the more. They pull you into the Halo universe and you immediately become attached to the characters. Great stories and insight into the award winning game, Halo. After reading it I wanted to play some Halo and kick some Covenant rear!"
"While I don't relish in Horror pictures, something about the supernatural power of Good triumphing over Evil fascinates me. I have never been into KING. I do however love this movie and would watch it for years to come. It was scary, but not as gorry or as bloody as most. It was a great mystery that had you going until the very end. The best scene was the brother's return. I Cried!!! Not of Fright but of simple Emotion. IT IS A MUST SEE even if you are not into the KING!!!!"
"I read this year's ago and loved it then. I enjoyed reading it again, wonderful book! This was the first book I read on my kindle, awesome!"
"In my opinion the only chapters worth reading are chapters 12, 13, 14 and 15. My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring. Chapter 2 shows an ostrich walk cycle, chapter 6 shows fighting skunks and chapter 8 shows a talking grave. I prefer ""Flash 5 Cartooning"" and ""Flash Cartoon Animation: Learn From The Pros"" over this book."
"The Last Unicorn was my favorite movie when I was a kid. The story is sweet, the animation lovely. I eagerly bought a copy on VHS when I saw it some years ago and awaited the release of the DVD with glee.Unfortunately, my glee was somewhat unfounded. While the movie itself is still as wonderful as ever, the DVD itself is shoddy work. The movie is only presented in fullscreen (though there was a widescreen laser disc available), there are no extras -- even the picture quality is less than outstanding.If you're looking to replace a worn VHS, this is certainly a good option. If, on the other hand, you are waiting for a DVD treatment worthy of this beautiful movie, you have more waiting ahead of you."
...The surround sound on this disc in non-existent. There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer. If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ... This label should be ashamed of itself to mislead the public into thinking this is some kind of new level in recorded music. ...
I had this gun about 6 months before it just quit working. Save your money and buy something else.
not really what i wanted xxxxv xxxxx xxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xx xxx x xxxxx xxxx zzzz zzzz zzzz
I thought it was a great movie. Personally i think it's the best out of the three out today.
"its the best music i have heard in some time. if you are in to world music or just looking for some thing diferent , well it does not get much better then this."
This film is difficult to watch for many reasons. It is below average both artistically and technically. The film is a classic of its genre but for me HUSBANDS and WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE are much better as films. [Note how the excessive laughter in FACES is annoying and unrealistic whilst in HUSBANDS it is natural and enjoyable.]
"I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well, bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the case.I can't be critical of much in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now, again, on dvd. It's well acted, well scripted, and well produced. I think Ian Richardson is my favourite Sherlock Holmes - although I don't think he played the role as many times as other actors. Again, he brings such confidence in his ability, that as a viewer you don't really think he's not going to solve the mystery.Thumbs up. Enjoy."
"Bought this to remove a wart. Weeks later of apply several times a day...minimal results.I threw it away. What a joke. I did then buy trichloroacetic acid 50% and boom...the wart was gone.More expensive, but cheaper than buying the ""freeze away"" over and over."
"The first two films were wonderful fun, and worth repeat viewing. I only managed to sit in the theater until the end of this one by mustering great fortitude. Compared to the first two episodes, ""Los Angeles"" is lamentably lame. Skip it."
"As a Psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health, I am utterly shocked and dismayed at this book. For those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace, please do not invest in this propaganda. This book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering. This type of hate mongering, intolerant, uneducated mindset is what has led to many of history's most devastating atrocities, done in the name of ""God."" A basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients. Shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor. You are an embarrassment to those of us who have dedicated our lives to trying to relieve human suffering."
"People are saying that moby is like a god, that he is one of the world best producer, people say that his this record, Play, is the album of the year, ¿?. I have heard this is the best techno album ever. I cannot understand this things. Please forgive me, but in my view, Play is simply a bad album. The only thing moby has made, is sample some old soul vinyls, and put music behind. And believe me, that the only good things of this album are these voices, which are the only things moby has not made. The drums are simply bad produced, the music is simply, and his voice is, oh my god!, why anybody has say to moby that he cannot sign?. You could say me you like some of the album songs, but please, DON'T SAY ME THAT MOBY IS A GOOD PRODUCER AND DON'T SAY THAT PLAY IS ONE OF THE BEST 90's ALBUM!!!"
"Despite what other people have said about this book, it is most likely the best fantasy book that I have EVER read! The people that complained about his language and choice of words obviously didn't read the book that I read. His vocabulary in this book was OUTSTANDING! I can't believe that he is only 19! And, just because he knows to use other words besides 'said' doesn't make the book tacky!!!!! I think that its awesome that he uses rich vocab. Many books written by accomplished authors don't even write as well as this man did!!! I can't believe that people could criticize a book and dislike it just because he has wonderful vocabulary in this book. The people whom criticized it probably are just upset and jealous because they didn't know what the words meant and don't have that good of a vocabulary. This book is awesome with a deep plot, developed characters, and tense battles. Read it!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river, two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots, you will relish this haunting book. I can't wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia."
"This small under-rated book is THE definitive book on virtually all drugs of abuse. It breaks down each of the drugs by category and by use, giving the properties of each and their derivation, and side effects including potential for addiction. Anyone interested in the chemical abuse field, or merely curious about some of the drugs they may be prescribed, will find this an exceptional buy."
This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!
"I had this book. I've read it twice. When I moved I left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it, knowing that I would probably get a digital version the next time I wanted to read it. $14.99 for a 40 year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores? That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake. Set a reasonable price for this book, and I'd happily purchase it!"
"First time I heard this album was sometime 2001.Was i surprised to know that the name did not sound brazilian.Who is this singer with such a light and mellow voice it was just so very pleasing to listen to.I bought the album the following day.Some more albums in the coming days.The albums now are one of my precious collections.Hoping against hope english versions come our way soonest.jun/los angeles,ca,usa"
"A beautiful book with detailed, descriptive, lovely drawings, this gift to my granddaughter was well received, and she takes it to bed every night."
"There are a lot of funny movies out there, but not many can be said to have so perfectly skewered their subject that they become archetypes. ""Office Space"" fits this latter category, doing for the modern, post-1980 workplace what ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" did for the Arthurian legend. That is to say, ""Office Space"" has become a part of our common culture, with shared concepts like ""pieces of flair"" and ""Is this good for the COMPANY?"" being common to the experience not only of cubicle slaves but all of us.Further, ""Office Space"", despite its outrageous plot, is just close enough to the truth of modern corporate America to hit home. Companies do promote incompetents and lay off their most skilled workers, all in the name of short-term quarterly profits. They do treat their employees like drones while rewarding upper management for cheating shareholders. To see this all turned against them goes a long way in explaining the success of ""Office Space."" It's a classic."
"this movie is terrible. charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread. if anything, you should see 100 girls. I dont think this movie should have even been made."
This movie is a classic and one that I enjoyed as a child growing up. The xtras on this set make it even more endearing for young and old alike.
The story of Eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and don't allow you to get completely sucked into the book. Overall its worth reading.
"As a list of what carts were made, it's ok. As a price guide this book is complete garbage. The prices it lists are guaranteed to get you laughed at and chased out of every video game store in America, if not the entire world."
"painful. Neither Paltrow nor Beckinsale were perfect either, but this one was appalling.This movie is packaged in 2 cassettes, and I couldn't even make it through the first one. Where do I begin? The hair was awful (especially Mr. Elton's), the casting was awful (Jeremy Northam will always be Mr. Knightley to me), the costumes were awful (zippers, anyone?). I hung in as long as I could to see what they did with Frank Churchill, but I just couldn't go on. So sad...My feeling about a good adaptation is that it should make you want to run out and buy the book. I'm glad I'd already read Emma 4 or 5 times because this movie certainly would not have made me desperate to read the book. I probably would have run screaming in the other direction.I did like their take on Mr. Woodhouse though. Thank Goodness for small favors!"
"Bought it one and half year ago from Circuit city. Used it mainly for general computer work, not gaming. When I upgraded to a newer machine and try to install it on it, has problem with driver on XP Media Center edition, can not record MIDI from my Yamaha keyboard, and they don't provide support for it any more. What kind of business is this vendor in? Only one and half year later, they don't provide any technical support for their products."
"I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine."
"Although I'll admit this CD has its charms, I firmly believe that it should not garner a five star rating. The detriments to this album include the following: first, the album is full of Lauryn Hill speaking inane lyrics that faintly resemble some sort of electronica instrument; second, the songs lack differentiation (as in they are mostly the same beat.); and finally, the bitter lyrics really give me a headache. (Disregard the rambling run-on sentances.)"
"Gordon didn't have a 'good experience' while recording this one...yet, it's classic Lightfoot...Dream Street should have been one of his biggest sellers."
"I enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things. However, he seemed to repeat the information a lot (guess repetition is the key to memory). It was to a point that annoyed me though, then again repetition annoys me period. lol. Also, somethings kinda contradicted themselves, but for the most part it was a pretty decent book and I did learn some things and def recommend this vs regular running relying on super thick soles praying the shoe will protect you. Which will! give you more injuries later down the road."
"The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on ""emotional states"" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book's far from perfect, but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic."
"To begin, the software installation is a headache. I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT. Why do you need a 40MB - 200MB driver that requires you to turn off your Anti-virus during installation?! The printer jams often and will sometimes shutdown while printing. While I think HP business grade printers are great, this consumer grade printer is junk."
"I had already read the book and the Eldest book before purchasing this set. It is an excellent quality audio book. It amazes me that one man did so many different voices. He is an excellent actor. The dragon's voice sounded funny to me at first, but now I can't believe they will use a women for the voice in the movie. Dragons are big creatures with big voices.A few friends have listened to the CDs because they didn't want to read it all before the December 15th movie is released. They loved it too and the Eldest CDs. Audio books done well can be a great way to experience a story. I have purchased other audio books that basically just read the book aloud. This was acting. Its worth the money. We have enjoyed listening to it at least 3 times since it was purchased."
Chronicles of the Kings # was a great introduction to the series. I gained a different insight into the History
After having the Keurig for one year the plastic lip inside where the coffee pod sits completely broke in several different pieces and landed in my coffee cup. Three friends of mine had the same thing happen after having the Keurig for a short time. It seems the heat from the Keurig eventually weakens this piece and makes it brittle enough to break apart.
"I don't typically read this kind of work, but picking it up at a real bargain price, it looked interesting, given all the media attention this renown profiler receives.His analysis of this collection of unsolved mystery murders showcases his analytical abilities, honed over years of work. He primarily spends a great deal of time on two key areas: context of area in which crime committed and victomology.From Jack the Ripper to JonBenet Ramsey, he applies all that years of working the toughest cases has brought to him.One that fascinated me the most was the one I knew the least, the Lindbergh kidnapping. The missing chisel, the removed flooring, all this pointing to the convicted one. Also, that Gen. Schwartzkopf's relative was involved.These cases do hold our yearning to solve mystery, especially that where justice is sought and all can see if their hunches play out."
"This movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam, worked next to someone loud and annoying, had a boss from Hell. This movie will get you to laugh. Especially enjoyable on particularly bad week at work (preferably cubical style)."
"Actually this isn't really even a movie, it's a really long music video. Maybe it's an advertisement, I don't know. All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters. This film lacks both. The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing's really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the ""alternate-scenario"" theme just didn't work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point. Is there a point? Somebody please enlighten me."
"The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind."
What a wonderful and often time touching story. It is very hard to believe what those men went thru. They were dealt one bad card after another and yet they still endured. I recommend this book to everyone. Especially those who think that they have is bad.
"Cinematography is just ONE ingredient of a good film, not thewhole recipe. This was a story with so much promise, yet it insistedon becoming eye-candy rather than a good movie...... END"
I Love this Toque! I work in a milk refrigerator and wear it in there all the time. Supper thick and comfy.
The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner. It was in the condition stated at the time of purchase. These are the things i am very pleased with. Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice. The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.
"I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to, and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended."
"I wanted more of a ""how to book"" on comic writing, concerning breaking in, making contacts, etc. Too much drawing plot comparisons and witty talk. It's a small enough book to skim through and I didn't find what I was looking for. Maybe it helps out the aleady established comic writer? But for those of us who have yet to make it. Nah."
"I love the ""jingle"" in this movie (x more days till Halloween, Halloween, Halloween etc) and being born on Halloween, it is even more fun. Now how do I get my movie?????"
"The price was attractive, as was the packaging. The box shows Curly. But alas - Curly is not easily found in this compilation. Also - a lot of the ""extra features"" are lame. Stay away from this product. If you really want the Three Stooges - buy the 8 volume compilation from Sony instead."
"I was excited to get my Steppin' album because I loved the other album of Christy Baron (I thought about you). However, I was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to I thought about you. I was expecting more of Christy Baron's sultry renditions of real accoustic jazz but what I got was some sort of a synthesized versions. It's still a good album but it's nothing like the other one. If you can only buy one album of Christy Baron, don't get this one."
Very fast response to my request. Excellent condition of the book. Would heartily recommend.
"Even though the price is more than what I wanted to pay, it was worth it. I like the choices of voices and ease of use. Like all GPSs, you have to get use to inaccuracies during your trip. It's good to study your route before heading out. Sometimes common sence is better than the GPS itself. Battery life is good. Just wish it would work with my current cell phone (EnV)."
"Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed! He's a Don Juan in the advertising world, who gets zapped by his blow-dryer while drinking some interesting-looking Cabernet. The result? He's given the ability to read women's thoughts. This is distressing, at first. Regressive, too: according to the writers (all women), these Turn-Of-The-Millennium-I'm-Every-Woman women primarily want to feast their eyes on Mel's tooshy. Hear me ROAR! Well, our hero soon learns to use his newfound Superpowers for his own profit, but then . . . ah, but then, the movie suddenly gets very serious. Most of the second act is dull. The movie finally wears out its welcome starting with about the last 15 minutes. Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend . . . which is REALLY What Women Want! (Kidding, kidding -- sheesh)"
"Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work,but I'll try.A French progressive outfit that blends old school Sabbath with celtic music.Would that formula even fly?It does here.Notice some truly inspired heavy guitar work along with some superb keyboard and flute playing on 'Great...'.A total of six cuts,with each one averaging eight minutes.Tunes I couldn't get enough of were the title track,""Great God Pan"",their Sabbath cover of ""A National Acrobat""(talk about covering an obscurity-great work!!)and the epic ""The Forest Of Koncerei"".A real keeper."
"Not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix. Keanu Reeves is semi-fine but miscast and he lacks a character the audience can root for and the rest of the movie is hit or miss in terms of the script which is badly written and the special effects which are not up to par in terms of what has been accomplish recently. I have to agree with what has been said about Rachel Weisz, who is the heart and soul of this movie and she does lift it over the mediocre script and funny dialog. Her performance is golden and worthy of a much better movie.See it for her alone but you will end up feeling sorry for her for being the only good thing about the whole movie."
"Purchased this in 2010. Doesn't keep coffee warm. Well, barely warm -- but significantly cooler than I'd like. My preference is a cup that is almost as warm as when it is first poured -- not crazy hot, but more than lukewarm. This isn't even close. And don't even think that it can warm up a cup that has started to cool because you've been carrying it around for a few minutes."
"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , is a very touching novel. It takes place in the 1920's and tells what life is like growing up back then , with all of the obstacles that come along the way. Francis is the main character of the book who grows up along with the trees in Brooklyn.She grows up in a poor family and struggles to fit in and find friends however, that does not bring her down. Francis is still a very happy and cheerful person regardless of what other people may try to tell her. She loves to read and since she doesn't have many friends, she feels and makes her books her friends. When Betty Smith wrote this book, she looked back on her life and the experiences she had, and put some of them in her book. It is written not only for teenagers or adults, but anyone who wants to read about the thrill of growing up. If you miss A Tree Grows In Brooklyn you are missing a truly great novel."
Go to a used bookstore. Search the internet. Scour the newsgroups. And find this book. I have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late Tryon does here. His mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists. Simply a sensational piece of work -- and a travesty that it's out of print.
"""Gods and Monsters"" is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"". The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellan in the lead. I thought it dragged in a few areas, but on the whole it was a great movie."
All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money. DONT BOTHER!
when you subscribe! I recently subscribed to this product and it really does make a difference in price! I recommend if you've got little Pamper babies to just go ahead and subscribe to this product :) I saved a bit even with my first shipment! HAPPY mommy!
I love this book for reference on the job. It has tons of diseases and has a great format. I used the full version in nursing school so I found it easy to navigate when i started to practive. It also comes with a code so you can download the book to your PDA.
"Not much new here. I listened to it for the Sarah song, and it is what gave it two stars. Not horrible, but the music is generic movie soundtrack music. The two versions of ""You Got A Friend In Me"" add nothing to the song. ""When She Loved Me"" is a nice song performed wonderfully by Sarah Mclachlan, but not enought to spend money on this whole CD."
Eragon is a fluffy version of Lord of the Rings or the Wheel of Time. It shouldn't have been published.I recommend reading The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman instead of Eragon. It is much deeper and much more original.
"The hardware itself is well-built. The display is high-contrast and easy to read, and the buttons have a good feel and are laid out rationally. The problem is with the software.The biggest problem is the fact that this device has the dealer stand on 16 (hard or soft), not 17, making the device useless for practicing Basic Strategy. There are a few other quirks with the software. A player's three or more card 21 wins instantly--no push against a dealer's 21. Also, the dealer doesn't expose his natural, allowing you to double-down or split against it and lose twice (but also allows you to surrender against it). You are only allowed to double-down on a 10 or ace, a rule seldom found in shoe games. An ace-9 combination shows up as ""10"", not ""20"", but settles the bet correctly if you stand. And due to screen size limitation, you must stand on any six card hand; fortunately, so must the dealer.All in all, a nice toy, but not a serious blackjack trainer."
"This is what I think my problem is... I didn't like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English, I would sit there and say to myself that I loved the descriptive, but not the flow of the sentence. I am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews. It has been a few years and I feel it is well deserving."
"1984 over all is a very boring book. Their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again. I don't really like futuristic based books and the book 1984 is a perfect example why. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one, unless your into this type of genre. I give this book 1*."
Kirk Whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster!! It doesn't deserve a mention let alone a place in the collection of true Jazz lovers. Please do not judge Whalum by this CD. I'd recommend 'Unconditional' instead.
"My 8 months baby loves it!!!, he may not fully understand what's all about but you can run it a couple of times a day and he sits there still to watch, recomended for everyone"
"If you enjoy books that take you through the full range of emotions, I think you'll enjoy this story. It's a study of the human spirit that gives hope to all, no matter your circumstance. Full of caring, love, and compassion, the author seems to have a heart as big as Wyoming. My only wish was that the story had been longer...or that I can hope for a sequel."
"If you read above, it says that there are 4 discs on this record. Then you look at the top and see only two discs. I expected the entire 4 disc collection, but got only two. So if this being advertised above as two and it says 4 down below, shouldnt this be corrected or is this a case of false advertising???"
This is an okay book in terms of the man's life (most info is culled from other sources) but when it comes to Denzel Washington's career the author commits an unpardonable sin. He writes way too much about each individual film the actor's made up to the time of the book's publication and then gives away the ending to each and every one of them!UNACCEPTABLE!!!!
i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutes.......it was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the same.....get What's the story morning glory....it rocks
"Ran into Bestbuy today grabbed the first DVD of Potter I saw. Got home, it was one disc no special features. Why not just make one edition like with all the other Potter movies? What a dirty rotten trick pulled by Warner Brothers. (...)"
"This DVD disc was not recognized on my Apple PowerBook G3 Firewire. The DVD drive tried to spin the disc up but gave up after a few seconds. There's no DVD icon on the desktop. I tried on both OS 9 and OS X, and ""df -k"" on OS X did not show a mounted volume in the DVD drive.Since the TF Season 1 Collector's Edition DVD discs play fine on the same laptop, it's got to be the TFTM DVD disc that's mastered non-Macintosh compatible. Major disappointment, since I own the Canadian VHS version of TFTM (containg that four-letter word) and was really looking forward to owning the uncensored edition on DVD."
"This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together. She pulled it off first in Lilac Bus and now Silver Wedding."
"I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket. After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead. Boy, was that a bad decision. We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds! Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this. I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED! Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket. I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier!"
Casino-quality chip set. Heavy-duty case. Set is very heavy -- accounts for the high shipping charge.
"While I wanted to LOVE this CD - I think Clay is the greatest example of the American ""Can Do"" philosophy, and a decent human being to boot - I was disappointed when I first listened. Other than ""This is the Night,"" the only track to wow me was ""I Survived You."" But, since I wanted to love it, and I had paid good money for the thing, I kept listening ... Then I fell - and I mean HARD! ... I DO love this CD ... No, it is not the greatest musical production ever (in fact, I think it is OVERproduced ... Clay's voice sings for itself - it needs less help, not more); but it is a fine start to a career that will cross many medias - (I would love to see Aiken on Broadway, Mr. Cowell!) and we will watch with wonder at the good this great man will do with his life and his time of fame. He is a performer worth supporting and encouraging ... You go Clay!"
Nowhere near as good as the book. Nothing like it. You might like the TV personalities though. Still love Deepak though. Smart man.
Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
"The author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows. In his history of this classic car, told from a British perspective, the text is easy to read, and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work. There are plenty of excellent photos, some in color but mostly not. I learned *why* the ignition key is on the floor (safety feature), and got further insights into this small company's heritage as an innovator, e.g. how, with the 96, they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the Citroen DS, or how they insisted, for safety reasons, on using heavier sheet metal than other makers, explaining its enduring status among automotive brands."
"This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the 16mm film version, or scanned from the VHS. I suspect the latter as the colors are washed out, and the film shows the 'Do not pirate this video tape' warning after the film. I might even be tempted to think this has not been produced by the studio as the DVD menu looks like it was made in iDVD on a Mac.The only plus side is that the film is the full content, including the scenes that are omitted from the TV broadcast version."
They are not fitted. They are very puffy and baggy. Do not fit at all like they are suppose to.
This is a great meditation on the Euchar5ist and its application to everyday life. I highly recommend it to believers (and others?)Ray Jorgensen
"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans."
"I was very disappointed in this book. She seems to have gotten bored with her characters. I have loved all the previous books, but it seems like someone forced her to write this one. Very disappointing. Very disjointed."
"Good to hear that there is someone out there that's popular in the clubs......but maintains a message and logic. Unfortuanatly I'm sure most of the fans don't have a clue as to what half there songs are about. Not unlike Dead Prez, Skinny Puppy, Antipop Consortium, Jeru Da Damaja, KRS-ONE etc. Everybody just wants to dance and be......entertained as the world around them falls apart.Anyhow, rants aside this is a very this album, it has a very Motown kind of sound to it though I'm sure that is just synths and not actual instruments.Regardless the M.C. is good, the words hard hittting, and like I say, Jello Biafra from the Dead Kennedys is on it, you can't go wrong!"
"First, let me say that I ordered this movie by mistake.I wanted to order more movies but I got this instead.How are you supposed to get the movies you want?Now I have the movie I want so I watch it. It is called theWorld's nuttiest nutcracker. Which is why I bought this moviebecause it's about world records for who is the nuttiest of all.Let me repeat that I hate cchristmass. But I love movies about christmass. I dont have to deal with my own family because I hate them. So now I watch this movie and I like it like 4 stars out of 5, it is insane. There are all these people in the moviethat look like cheap plastic, but wait they are not real, they are realtime 3d people/fruit. So that caught my Eye and I loved the fact that this was a good choice to buy and then watch thisawfull film"
"I first was given this book to read over thirty years ago as a very young Christian. I could hardly put it down. I was so struck by the very personal relationship David Wilkerson had with God and how God led and guided him so intimatley. It caused me to seek God's direciton in my own persoanl life and I can honestly say, changed the whole depth of my relationship with God.I work with teens who are incarecerated and I recently had one of them tell me that becasue of reading this book, he now believes there is a God. He was struck at how God led this man so personally. The kids love the book. This book and ""Run Baby Run,"" which is it's counterpart, are a couple of the most popular books that kids check out in my little library I offer them in the detention center.I highly reccomend this book. It is an awesome true story!"
"I am surprised at so many positive reviews. The prose in this book is very poor quality, it's simplistic, repeptitive and many times plain silly. It reads like a quick amateur effort. While I think that the autor is entitled to the right to fictionalize some characters or events, i can't understand why her language is so dismal."
I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!
"This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the ""new James Bond"" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond, Vin Diesel could NEVER compare to him and he was the worst James bond ever!! The stunts in this movie are awesome, but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE!! I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence. This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit!!! Vin is sexy (although he sometimes force it), but nothing and I do mean NOTHING should excuse him for making this mess. C'mon Vin, do better next time!!"
"I've seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'"
"This is a great movie!Its 1969. Alan Parish has troubles with his father. He finds a game named Jumanji at a construction site. He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle. They play, and until the game reads 5 or 8, in the jungle he must wait. The game isn't played until 26 years later by a young girl and boy that will be living in the Parish home. Peter, the young boy, rolls a 5, or 8, and he is unleashed. This wild movie is all in one day! It turns out they can not play until Sarah Whiddle joins. They find her and the whole town, including her try to believe it was the father that killed him. I hate to say it, but the ending is sad. Once they finish the game, it should all dissappear. Robin Williams isn't the only one relased from the game. Who else? Go buy it now!"
"This is truly the best CD that I have bought in a very long time. I followed Clay Aiken all through AI2, loved the first single, was a little worried about the debut CD! I was so ""blown away"" by the songs, his voice, and the fact that his character comes through every song. What an incredible way to start a career! I am anxiously awating the next CD that he puts out. Thanks Clay, you have shown us that singing is still alive!"
We bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts. I wouldn't have paid $40 for them but they were an excellent bargain at $10 each. I should have bought one for myself.
THIS IF FOR THE MUSIC FAN FROM WASHINGTON STATEIF ANYONE HAS POOPY FOR BRAINS IT IS YOU.MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICEABOUT SOMEBODY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.CLAY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A WONDERFUL CD AND IS A NICERESPECTUL PERSON - YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM HIM.
My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
"I've had this unit now for two years and it still works like a champ for an FM transmitter. There's static on some channels when I travel, but I'm competing against much higher bandwidth. Worth the money for someone looking to just enjoy their tunes without a full audio facelift."
"This movie was pretty good, though there is a lot of sex, drugs, drinking, violence etc... I'm from NYC and some ppl i know are like that i think it shows what teen life is like for some ppl in NY. I loved how they used Washington Sq. Park-a lot of ppl that are like the charaters in the movie go to that park for the same reasons... skateboard, pick fights, do drugs etc.... This movie seemed so real and i hope there would be more movies like this. -14"
"The examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems. Never explain how to do bode plot at all. I am glad I know how to do differential equations before taking the class, otherwise, to use the method that taught by this book, I would be dead. They never explain well on those differential equations and the concept behind."
"I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences."
"Freud's ""The Interpretation of Dreams"" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory."
"This is the best cement I've yet used for keeping my replacement gasket in place on my Big Green Egg. I'm now using a fiberglass stove gasket, and it's worked the best of any I've tried. This is easy to apply and holds up to the heat better than the black stuff I used before."
"I had seen various movie versions, and knew the story well. However it was fun just to read Dickens original ."
"My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing ""Who was that singing ?"""
"Just love this little pot. Have been a Farberware user for over 35 years and finally replaced my 3 quart saucepan with this gem. It's a great size for a small family, doesn't take up much room on the stovetop. Only concern is that the handles do get hot and you need to use a glove or towel to use the handles after boiling or high temps. I would recommend this pot to anyone in the market for mini-size soup/stew preparations."
"If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied."
"I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved."
"Reading through the table of contents of the book I had this sense of familiarity. The first few chapters have been titled and themed in such a way that it bring to mind the creation story found in the Bible. Granted, that's not what this book is about and I don't believe the story of creation found in the pages of Genesis is meant to be taken as literal scientific fact, however, I appreciate the sense of wonder and significance the framing gives to the beginning of time (even though, taken as is, it's not as if the beginning of our universe was lacking in wonder). Still, by borrowing a bit from the structure of the Genesis story, I think Ackroyd gives a bit of familiarity to the history and science he's sharing. Ackroyd weaves together science, a storytellers skill, easy page layout, and fascinating pictures and illustrations for a good overview of the very beginning of our planet to the final emergence of Homo sapiens."
"I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!"
"The product description states that the sizing is based on neck size, however you don't provide any measurement with the corresponding S,M,L sizes. Are we supposed to guess at the measurements? It might be easier to shoot darts blind-folded!"
Oh my gosh. I f you are looking for an interesting book to read. Don't read Treasure Island. It is totally on a reading level for way older people. Not 7th graders. I had to read this book in class and it was so hard to understand that I gave up and fell asleep. Boring Book. I wouldn't even classify it as a classic. I would classify it as a good way to put yourself to sleep.
"This is a thick book with tons of information. Guaranteed to help out any nursing student or even just a good book to have as a nurse. However, it is hard to navigate this book, it takes some looking around before you can figure it out."
"I bought my first Wilbur Smith book Nov'86. It was translated to Swedish. At that time (being 22 years old) I hadn't yet started to read in english on a regular basis. Out of curiosity I counted the books from this author that I had bought over the years, and I found to my surprise that I had 19 different novels. I like all of them. If you purchase 'Birds of Prey' it is a good introduction to also buy other novels from the same author. Just a warning; dont pick it up and start to read unless you know that you have some time to spare. This book will not let you do other things for a while. All of his books are entertaining, highly interesting and yet educational at the same time. The perfect companion to bring when you want to have a quiet moment on your own and relax with a good book."
"This film is shot well, has a great soundtrack, and is definitely a great early piece by Scorsese. There's no real obvious plot line, but it's still a fun movie."
"This book is so mesmerizing! Try ""Perla at the Mexican Border..."" (p. 41):Her job was to sort through the eyes/ of dolls. Snapping hollow limbs/ into plastic torsos had been a soothing task/ for Perla, like arranging the peas into the pod/Beautiful imagery in very simple moments. Gonzalez doesn't take anything for granted. Small moments become big ones. This is exemplary poetry. I recommend this to everyone I know!!! The NPS made a great choice!"
"Bought my nail gun about 2 yrs ago. Have driven many 2 1/2 in nails in oak, maple,cherry and pine and never had a misfire or jam once. Like this gun so much I bought one for my father-in-law for christmas. And yes I like him. Would recommend this finish nailer to anyone."
"This is LOTR light; Well written, but not nearly to the fullest extent of the literary powers Tolkein reached later with LOTR. The story too, is more for younger folks. It should however be read before LOTR because it provides necessary background. It's a quick read too - 1 day."
"The politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters. I really wanted to like the book, but, like a number of other reviewers, I could only make it part way through. PS. enough with the F-word already. It may be hip, but it's jarring especailly when used incessently."
What the hell? Weird and beyond disturbing. I had trouble figuring this one out. Didn't care for this one at all.
"As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work."
"I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought ""another one of your lousy stories"" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars,Ontario,and I reccommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!!!Nobody writes like Jean M. Not ever.This book made me laugh,as well as cry. I have read all of her books,and am eagerly awaiting her 5th book.I love this book! I would give it 10000000 stars,if possible. If anyone dares to insult her work in my presence......."
"Perhaps the best thing to say about this Songbook is what Ira Gershwin said after hearing it. "" I did not realize how good our songs( George and Ira Gershwin) were until I heard Ella sing them. In these Songbooks she is at her mature best. Her voice is smooth, elegant, clear , beautifully nuanced, rich in range, remarkable. It is sheer joy to listen to her in the very best of the songs. While many prefer the drive and rhythm of Ellington I myself prefer the more lyrical and slower swinging pieces. But what is important is that this is a great Masterpiece which presents the great works of the American Songook in the best way possible.One can listen to these songs again and again , and doing so brings only greater pleasure."
"This has everything to do with the recent movie and nothing to do with the real book. The real book had messages that were really lost in the recent film, it was close to a modern day Gulliver's Travels, raising questions about how we treat animals, our science and our society.This will no doubt be fairly close to the recent film, which is okay hokum. Excepting the massive holes in the plot of the recent movie... How did horses arrive on the planet? Where were the non-chimps on the station etc?"
"I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but it may be a touch overrated. Adequate if not good performances by all members of the cast, especially Christian Bale, who comes across as interesting, charismatic, and likeable. The imagery may have been a bit run of the mill compared to a Tim Burton rendering. Nonetheless, the Batman franchise seems to still be alive and well with this latest edition. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."
"This one of the worst abominations ever put in print to ""describe"" Catholicism. It is of note only for its ludicrous claims, half-truths, and outright lies. DON'T BE FOOLED: THIS TEXT IS NOTHING MORE THAN RUN-OF-THE-MILL, PITIFULLY IGNORANT ANTI-CATHOLICISM AT ITS WORST.It has value only as an example of atrocious scholarship, flagrant misrepresentation, and outright bigotry."
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the amazingly low price for this product. I guess I got what I paid for since these pills did not work at all. The ingredients list the same as Phazyme but offered no relief.
what an incredible botch job! the laserdisc rocks! and I understand so does the vhs version...but this DVD cuts out songs...cuts up songs...and generally dissapoints...THE INTERVIEWS SHOULD BE IN ADDITION TO...NOT ..instead off SONY..get it right! and put this out AGAIN!
"this bok was recommed to me by my daughterinlaw,it was warm and funny and so true of Loretta Lynn,full of truth and surprises"
"As much as I enjoyed System of A down's first effort, it took me a long time to get into this one. But I guess i'm like that with every new cd a band comes out with. Anyway. I think that on this cd Serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song, but I was disapointed that the drummer, did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the band's self-titled debut. All in all i really enjoyed this cd and I would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into System of a down. The single ""Chop Suey!"" is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon. Although the sound of the song is a bit more radio-friendly than the rest of the cd, it is still a great song. Another song with great talent is the song ""Toxicity"" which has proven to become my favorite on this multi-faceted album."
"It's a full hour of A Prairie Home Companion, not just the best bits from various shows. The version of the small church's struggle to find a musical director seems different from the one I have on another CD, but it's all delightful. Great way to spend an hour while driving in the country. WARNING: do not attempt to operate vehicle in town or under complicated road conditions while listening to any PHC CD. These require some brainwork, and I've almost driven off the road laughing a couple of times."
"An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky 'now who was that' style cameos, a la John Myers Myers' Silverlock.Dracula has found another way to be in charge in England, by marrying in to the royal family. To prevent problems, he has had the Great Detective thrown in a prison camp.So when a serial killed called Silver Knife is killing vampire whores, it falls to the Diogenes Club to investigate. Vampires heal normal wounds, but not silver. The investigation uncovers a lot more than just a chain of killings."
Very good. READ until 5:00 AM and could not wait to finish the book today. Would recommend it to any age group.
"As a banker, one never wants to have to be in the position of collecting bad debts. Mr. Lewis has done a great job describing the process -- a terrific reference for anyone who needs an experienced perspective on the process!"
"This is waaay before the age of personal trainers. Not only is their a small amount of bare skin, but the bare skin they show ain't worth seein'. This stuff got better in the 80s, when there was ample supply of attractive, and less inhibited women."
"My 2 year old son received this toy as a gift. Although he somewhat enjoys playing with it, I was seriously disappointed with the functionality of the click bricks.First, the click bricks don't 'stick' together well. If you pick up two joined sections or try to reposition them they fall apart -- very frustrating for a 2 year old!! I think the magnets are way too weak. Some of the magnets don't work at all!Second, you can't really build much of anything with the pieces in this set. They have some neat pictures of built projects on the box, but good luck recreating them!I would absolutely not recommend this toy. My son has MUCH more fun playing with his Mega Blocks and with his basic wooden alphabet blocks. Hope this review is helpful to you!"
"The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American."
"This CD is really , really awesome. It's not that i only like this heavy metal/rock genre. Quite frankly, i like every type of music, besides country, that is.(heh) This is a review coming a person who likes everything from Dido to Disturbed. rap, rock, whatever, i like it all. This is just a really good CD for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste. Very great work from SOAD that should be enjoyed by everyone"
"This charger worked fine for a few months, but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it's charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality."
I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not.
"This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that). The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, ""Marmee"" goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other. This is a wonderful classic, and I encourage you to read the book,watch the movie, or listen to the cassete (of which I have done all three!)."
"Be honest people, this is not a horror movie or a scary movie...this is just pure garbage. What cinematic value does this movie have to offer? ZERO. I am all for horror movies, but this movie just is not horror, scary or even shocking...it's just lame! It is about the raping of a girl and she gets revenge. WOW, what a worthless...waste."
"It's a great book. But the Mindstorms microproessor is now NXT -- it has been updated. Until this book is updated, you'd be better off to find a good book which is based on the NXT system."
"Our whole family loved this video. It is not only a great introduction to skiing for new skiiers in the family (both young and old alike), but also gets you excited and ready to hit the slopes come winter. For intermediates, this is also an excellent review of the basics and some things you might have missed along the way. Don't miss this one!"
"Although this book, is considered a great work of literature, written to describe the harshness of Purtian New England. Plus, this book was heavily laiden with symbolism, and many other literary tools.The scarlet letter is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. Not only is it boring, no true action occurs in this book. Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. This boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison door.Although the author did a creative job of conveying his point, this is still the worst book I have ever read. I would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first 10 pages. This is a good book to study, however it is not a good book to read for pleasure, under any circumstance!!"
"This is one of the few satisfying movies I can remember seeing. Apart from loving Dennis Quaid, who puts in a great performance, I like this film for its unabashed good storytelling. It is tense because it allows us to grow incredibly involved with the characters. Moreover, apart from the usual coincidence thing, the science fiction plot doesn't have holes. May you enjoy this movie as much as I did!"
"I liked how it started, with the beheading of a relative. And details of court life were interesting, at the beginning, but became tedious with the repetitiveness. This book really could have been half or one-third the size, it drug on and on and on. Getting to the end was a relief, I doubt I'll read another book by this author."
"It was good, is not like out of this world and really amazing, but it works soooooo good! If you put a lot of pressure when your using it, it turns off automatically, that sucks!"
"I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting, but it kept deviating away from the story and introduced way too many characters, that in my opinion, had little or nothing to do with the story. It's almost as if this was a short story stretched into novel length. Either that or the author was under a deadline to crank the next book out and this is the result. Still overall it wasn't terrible, but still not one of his best works, that's for certain."
This rice cooker works great. My only complaint is with Amazon. This is the 2nd non-book item I've ordered from Amazon and I don't understand why these items are only shipped in their mfg packaging with no exterior boxing. Thankfully this item arrived in good shape. This is something to think about when ordering non-book items from Amazon.
"I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)"
"Basically, it goes like this, Eastern European intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex. At the end, of what seems frigging hours and hours of self-loathing, when they finally find happiness, they all die in a truck accident."
"was a great book. Unlike LOTR which i tried to read once, I found this book to be very easy to read, and it went rather quickly."
"Hundreds of reviews of this book have been written over the years. And no wonder! It's author did not become a Christian til in his 40's when he came, as he tells it, ""kicking and screaming into the kingdom!""He's heavy weight intellectual (taught both Oxford and Cambridge) but able to write clearly for us commoners as well. The many copies I have given away over the years have gone to Christians who need a clearer understanding of their faith, as well as to nonChristians who need to understand that Christianity is quite intellectually respectable - and possibly even TRUE!"
"I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel. I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had, or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical. Mine went back. A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain. If you buy these, buy them from a place with a good return policy. Keep the packaging and invoice."
"Very attractive, solid and sturdy, materials are very well organized. Not the cheapest, but well worth it -- especially at the discount Amazon provides... And then there's the content -- top notch stuff, perfect."
"As can be found on eric.ed.gov and cbpp.org, and in this review at the Harvard Educational Review ([...]), the correct author of this book is Arloc Sherman.Marian Wright Edelman, a highly noted scholar and activist for children, wrote the Introduction, while Robert M. Solow wrote the Foreword."
"Jamie Oliver's original TV show is superb, better than his subsequent ones. The episodes on this DVD (Season 1) are: Chef's Night Out, Hen Night, Babysitting, the Band, Birthday Party, Girlfriend, and Christmas Comes Early, with a special feature ""pick a dish"" (dish by ingredient and method)."
"I read this book and it's obvious that Eartha Kitt has a problem with being black. She claims that the reason they didn't show the movie she was in with Sammy Davis Jr. in the South, was because the racist Southerners might believe she was white. If Eartha Kitt thinks that she would be mistaken for white, then excuse me, but this is the Queen of England typing this review."
"Even though my four year old wasn't ready for the entire movie, she refused to leave until the credits were over because she loved the music so much! I think this is a great soundtrack for both grownups and children- it does allow you to visualize some of the fantastic scenes in the movie with silly songs like ""Hot Chocolate"", yet the soundtrack also throws in some of the beloved Christmas classics for good measure. All in all, it is a great compilation that should please both children and adults alike."
"This book is very good. The story line is fantastic and I cannot put it down. There is one problem, however. This book was very poorly proofread if proofread at all. There are many grammatical mistakes and other errors that middle school students could eliminate if they had read their work. Nonetheless, I highly recommend The Fall of reach and the rest of the series as long as you are able to overlook certain imperfections."
"Well, how can I review this product when it still haven't arrived. It has apparently been resent but once again hasn't arrived. Very disappointed!!!!"
"I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!"
Not sure why I added this one to my large collection but it is now one of my favorites. My biggest regret is not getting to see him live before he died. Unlike some CDs where there is only one or 2 good songs this one has lots of great songs.
"I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating."
"Ben Stiller and Edward Norton play best friends Jake and Brian, a rabbi and a priest who are both strong leaders in their congregations. When their friend Anna visits them, both friends fall for her and find themselves questioning their faiths.This is a sweet and often funny movie that is well written and acted by the cast. Religion can be a tough subject to base a comedy around, but Keeping the Faith does pretty well. The plot itself seems to unwind a bit near the end, but Ben Stiller and Edward Norton keep it afloat pretty well.This is a pretty good movie, so I recommend it for a Saturday afternoon."
"Worst movie, worst acting, and worst script, this would win hands down. When it comes to lame, witless and downright stupid movies, Ben Stiller is on quite a roll. If you are not a teenaged boy, I recommend staying away from this one.Dodgeball fancies itself as a parody of the typical sports movie, don't fall for it. The non-stop toilet humor is lame and predictable and it's a wonder that this movie can garner such rave reviews from so many people.In my humble opinion, if you have an IQ greater than 12, don't bother with Dodgeball. Personally, I'd sooner watch a marathon of Paulie Shore and Carrot Top movies before sitting thru Dodgeball again, and that my friends, is saying something."
"While Golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature, he is a fool for having created such an implausible plot.Boys of that age rarely attack people under any circumstances.Instaed, they use more subtle forms of psychological warfare.They could only have acted like that if they had had to eat each other to survive. To expect boys to shrug off social conditioning in such a short time is, however absurd."
"I had seen this movie on TV way back in 1991 on a local PBS station. I hadn't seen it since then. So when I got this DVD recently, I was really looking forward to seeing it again. I remembered how well-acted this movie was.It is a very good movie. However, I noticed that some of the dialogue seemed a little ""forced"" in certain parts. You could tell that the actors were ""reading"" scripted lines. This only happened in a couple places. Other than that, all the other dialogue was rendered in a natural and effective way.This movie is quite sad, and the actors really bring that across. You can sense their pain and hurt as they work through the anguish of Andre's death.This is a very good movie (and very short). Well worth the investment!"
"Hoku's ridicousily stupid ""Another Dumb Blonde"" is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen. Hoku didn't even write the song and the melody and lyrics are horid. Hoku is no small package thoiugh- she's two doughnuts away from 200. The title alone states perfectly what she is- another dumb blonde."
"I broke this piece of junk in half, it did damage to my PC. I dont care about losing the CD. It's the principle!! Release this like a normal CD and I will buy it or I will go to ITunes and download and have freedom with the music. That's after I find a way to get rid of the virus this thing infected my PC with. My computer has since been hacked. Sell me a virus and you can keep it, I will never buy garbage with this kind of software attached again (no matter who the artist)!!"
"It's moody, a little dark, like for driving down the highway at night . . . But that's why I loved it in the 1980's ! I just was never able to find the CD ! To me, it is the most well-done, well-produced album by Tommy Shaw, as I have heard most of his others to date . . . Still, yes, it has a certain heavy keyboard-80's sound, but it is more 'serious' than his other efforts in my humble opinion . . .So, dark, but GREAT guitar, it should have really been the concept for another Styx album, instead of the more light-wieght stuff they all have done . . ."
"I do think this item works great as a mop and as a dust mop, it really picks up all of the hair, fuzz and dust. Sadly(this is why it isn't 5 stars), corners and edges will find you using a regular broom, instead of this gadget, as it just can't handle those areas. I love that I can throw the pads in the washer and let them air dry -- no more mopping with anything less than clean."
"What can I say? This CD is pretty much everything the other Cowboy Bebop CD's aren't. It's pretty much either 1) Take a perfectly good track and ruin it by throwing a lot of drums on top (Vibert) or 2) as far as I can tell, calling a mediocre lifeless piece of electronic pap by the same name as a totally dissimilar but good track off another CD (4 Hero). Either way, the originals far outshine any of the pointless meddling done on this CD.On the does/doesn't include Vitaminless topic, I got this album by mistake. I ordered Vitaminless but what I got was a double CD of this and Vitaminless. I can't imagine a more mistaken pairing."
"The book has no information on Kerry's ""tour of duty"" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the ""new"" Vietnam."
"Instead of being a better product, this one is made cheaper and seems flimsy and doesn't respond like the ""older"" versions. Aren't things supposed to get better? This one is made in China--where all the leaded paint and computer things are being messed with/sabatoged?Wish I'd gone into a store and looked at it, held it (this one is lighter & not good quality) and the color is dark (not the bright red or blue I've always used/seen) and hard to read the text, too.Would have sent it back, but for the shipping costs (which ran up the price)."
I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me...
This CD sent chills down my spine. Clay Aiken is a very gifted vocalist.
"This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star, only because zero is not an option. My son really wanted this toy, and when he got it, he played with it for about 5 minutes, and walked away. Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is. It comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car. Nice concept, except the thing doesn't come out all the way, so my son ends up pulling the thing out. There are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions, they don't. The tower keeps falling off of it. All around, I can't believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money. You would think I bought it at the dollar store or something. I would urge all who consider buying this toy, to talk your kid into something else. IT'S TERRIBLE!!!"
This product is light in weight and good for smaller non parralel limb bows. I have a Mathews Reezen and it was too small. Amazon has a great return policy and traded for Plano Max XT.
"If you took out every comment by cast, writers and producers on trying (unsuccessfully)to figure out Lorne Michaels, this heavy tome would easily be cut in half. Too much whining, too little interesting, historical information for me, a long time fan of the show."
"I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with ""mi tierra"". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best."
"This book works on so many levels, it's mind boggling...it's an adventure story, it's a philosophical novel of ideas, it's got brilliant use of language. Like a painter, Conrad creates effects by deciding what to put in and what to leave out; he shifts narrators and fractures the time sequence to get maximum impact from his story. If you don't get it the first time, try again (I've read it many, many times). It's pure poetry and a genuinely profound book. The review below from VA that describes Conrad's theme (facing your fears) is totally right on the money -- so face your fears about reading a difficult book, buy a copy of Lord Jim and read it, and you'll be a better person for the experience."
"We own many Bible story books, but this one is my favorite. We read from this book every day, and the kids love it. It includes stories that are left out of many children's Bible story books. It is wonderful to read in order, and it really keeps the attention of the children. When it's time to shut the book, my kids say, ""What's the story for tomorrow called, Mommy?"", because they so look forward to reading this book."
"Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming, and these stories certainly showcase his talents. I had a wonderful time reading them and every time he surprised me with the twists - sometimes several twists in each story. I particularly was caught flat-footed by ""Triangle"" and ""The Christmas Present"" (which had one of those multi-twists I mentioned). Of course, as I said, I was surprised and delighted by each of the stories and I'm sure that anyone who is familiar with Mr. Deaver's work and/or who enjoys thrillers/suspense will enjoy the stories in this book. Characters range from Shakespeare (oh, yea!) to Deaver's iconic Lincoln Rhyme as well as a host of new characters to delight and entertain readers.And, of course, once you've finished this one you can go on and get the sequel,More Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II. Both books heartily endorsed by yours truly!"
I thought that this was a positive development in the series bringing in new characters and expanding on the plot world's development. The first part is devoted to developing new characters and expanding threads while the last third is action with the characters. This has a lot of foreshadowing and will fit in with follow books and new series. Overall worthwhile. Reads best when in conjunction with the other books in the series.
"Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book. The were best friends in childhood and that friendship continues into adulthood. Both are married to other people and when Gina's marriage ends she ends up in at Lawrences house being comforted in his arms. His wife is somewhat understanding but feels that Gina often outstays her welcome. Gina goes through every ""poor me"" emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying! Will someone please write a book where the betrayed women moves on and becomes strong without having to virtually distroy her teenage childrens' lives too?!!!I won't go into detail of what happens next in case you decide to read this boring novel but let's just say that it's predictable, yet boring, with no really likeable characters. Very flatly written! I give it 2 stars..."
"This is an absolutely terrible transfer. It is ridden with edge enhancement (halos on contrasting edges) and severe noise reduction (smoothing the image to reduce film grain -- AND detail). This is so severe that film elements such as arrows and spears in the battle at the beginning are not visible. It's barely an upgrade over DVD, and simply not what a movie of this caliber deserves. It is extremely unfortunate that such an outstanding movie has been treated so poorly. Stick with the DVD and don't buy this blu-ray disc."
Best Batman Series!!! This is a great start to a fantastic story line! This gives great detail to the development of the character who becomes the Dark Knight!! A must see film and must see series!
"This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray, a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel's wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!"
"I thought that ""Treasure Island"" was a very good, exciting book and it made me want to read. There were some parts that were not as interesting as others and they needed some excitment and at these parts I didnt think that I was going to like the book, but by the end I didnt want it to be over. I thought it was very exciting how they were on the island with all these pirates and how they were both going after the same thing, the treasue. Adding new characters and taking away some of the old ones,death, was also a part of how it made it interesting. over all it is a very good book and I advise people of all ages to read it"
"Maybe this book is out of copyright or something... but this printing is a grossly lazy reproduction of the original printing. It's actually a copy of the pages - not even fit right to the book's size. They didn't bother to transcribe and properly typeset the text using a modern system, so you're basically paying for a very rough, poorly scaled photocopy of the old printing. No wonder it's not available on Kindle."
"This book is nothing more than a 160 page ad for Stauber's school/store in CakeEater, MN. There is no ""How To"" advise in this book."
"Unit worked well for what it is, a small and versatile glue gun for small home repairs and crafts. The batteries are really really bad. And unfortunately they did not build in an adapter to use the included AC plug. That would have been helpful so that when the batteries die we could still use the unit. Bad engineering.Buy a corded gun if you are serious and never worry about batteries again."
"I really love this short movie, and I'm glad I could actually FIND it and for a great price. So, thanks a bunch!"
"If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated."
"I haven't liked much recent American pop, but Clay sure is a good singer. I watched him perform ""Invisible"" on the Billboard Awards... I was completely blown away. Simply amazing. A friend had also sent me his This is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water single earlier this year. Amazing as well. Good work, Clay. Hope your future albums are excellent as well."
"This case is strongly made and closes well. However, the included foam inserts are very cheap and offer no support. After carefully making cut-outs for my XD-9, I found that the foam was too feeble to support the gun properly and just looked cheap and saggy.After a difficult search on the web, I discovered another case maker, Pelican (on ebay), that sold replacement foam inserts, which I ordered. I found these to be of far better quality and well support the gun and accessories.In the end, it would have been cheaper and easier to have just bought the case from Pelican in the first place.To be honest, even the Pelican foam is not as good as the foam I used to use in the UK to carry heavy cameras in alluminum cases. That foam had a velvet surface and was extremely firm, but God only knows where to buy that!"
"it's the best lube i've used so far, just a bit expensive and that's the only thing wrong with it"
"This CD player is a great one when it comes to travel and portability. But only four months after I got it, the headphones stopped working (properly). When they do work, they don't work on the left side, and you usually have to play around with it before it does. But still, it's a great system. Nice audio quality, too."
"I remember watching the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies as a child from start to finish and then immediately rewinding them to start again. This movie is an intirely different story. Not only was it a far cry from the book version, I found it to be incredibly insulting. The anti-American sediment found throughout the movie is something that I took to heart and I belive that Kevin Sullivan did a wonderful job at alienating much of his audience by the thoughtless comments made in this film. I have about as much respect for him now, as he has for half of the people who have supported him by buying his movies. I will never buy another one of his films and unfortunatly, this is a movie that I will never share with my own children."
"Living In Chaos Is Living In Stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting. This book is personal in that it is about peoples' private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody. Whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life, something drastic can happen and change your world around. The stories are touching, yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of life.I would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life."
"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."
"This is among the worst fantasy books I have ever read, and it infuriates me that it is getting so much attention. I could possibly forgive the utter lack of ingenuity of its plot or the language, which is more suited for a 7-year-old, if only I saw some signs of the author caring about the quality of his book. Unfortunately, it is obvious for the entire first third of the book that it was not even edited for basic grammar, and I find it insulting."
"Destination Unknown by Mest, is such a great CD, their songs are songs that people can relate to, and the catchyness of the songs will stick in your head. This Cd is by far the best cd i've heard yet."
This is a fantastic overall collection of Doo-Wop groups/songs i have heard.This covers most of the variations of songs let alone the big hits of the day many years back
"This book is full of many wonderful ideas on how to achieve your own 'white' space. The effect is fresh and romantic, and somehow soothing. The images within are simply elegant. Lovely, and highly recommended!"
Bought this to replace a very expensive crystal set I'd given away and like it a lot for the money. It's pretty and functional. Comes nicely packaged too. Would not hesitate to give as a gift.
"Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot, let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful, in that it puts one of the main characters from the TV show in a very negative light. This particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un-called for. No reason to see this at all."
"My kids and I really enjoy Creature Comforts. It is laid-back dry British Humor, the characters and voices together make the creatures endearing. Clean humor. It has no plot to speak of and no action. So if those are important to you, you might not like it."
"Good stuff - some funny, some serious, but all the little ""stories"" you've never heard from behind the curtain at SNL!"
"Have Spacesuit, Will Travel is one of the best of Heinlein's so-called juveniles (which I've always believed were some of his best writing) and now it is available is a really excellent audio recording. The Full Cast Audio treatment takes a great story and makes it come alive. Highly recommended!"
"Although The Hobbit tends to be a childs book it is a must read before the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga.It is also about to hit the big screen."
this book is for christians and i am not a christian. i cannot use this in my work as it is illegal for me to foster christian beliefs on my residential clients. i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based. i feel ripped off.
The entire contents of this book could fit on one page of paper.The remainder of the book is filled with art and babble. There's even recipes in the back (not kidding).Do not buy this book unless you want to learn first hand how to get ripped off today.
I was never much of an r and b fan till i heard this album. R. Kelly is an amazing artist and this is his best work yet. There are very few album where i can listen to every song from start to finish but this is one of them. If you have any doubts about getting this album BUY IT. you wont regret it.
"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece."
"After SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and, most recently, BLEACHERS I had begun to believe that John Grisham had been abducted by aliens. But with THE LAST JUROR Grisham comes home to what he knows best: legal literature.THE LAST JUROR tells the story of a young newspaperman who scrapes his funds together, along with help from family to buy The Clanton Times his old paper when he was starting out in the world of journalism. Playing his cards right and reporting on the ""dangerous"" story of a brutal crime and the trial that ensues, the paper is off and running.But, when perpetrator of the crime is released from prison early and members of the jury start turning up dead, the people of small town Clanton are faced with the vengeance of the criminal and his family.Okay, the resolution of the story is predictable but THE LAST JUROR but the writing is vintage Grisham and marks his almost prodigal return to legal drama and that's certainly worth the wait.THE HORSEMAN"
"There is a scene at the beginning of this classic movie wherein everyone seems to be having a great time in a bar when from nowhere a sort of stop-time moment occurs when dectective Popeye eyeing some locals knows for dead-center certainty something major is wrong. From there it is only a matter of piecing together (like the ubiquous and sinsiter car) the plot. This gritty, seemingly greyish and astonishingly well-edited movie offers a powerful glimpse into the mechanisms and travails of international corruption"
I couldn't put this book down. If you are a history buff like me this is like brain candy. Nothing too in depth but a fun read.
This item is misrepresented in the description. It comes with a strap that cannot be attached without buying and installing an end pin and it says it comes with a pitch pipe which was not included. The product details are misleading and although the price is good you do not get what you think you are paying for.
"One of the finest books on Hollywood's master photographer, George Hurrell. The author not only is an expert in his own right, but he knew Hurrell. That special blend along with the fact the author knows how to write and chose some wonderful never seen before photos makes this book one very satisfying bedtime meal. Great reading"
"The Best MOvie I have even seen. Great directing and acting! Has everything you want, action, love, romance! It has it all!"
"I love this pan. I use it practically every day. We received one for our marriage, and, after 20 years, I finally had to replace it. (A second one we received a few years later is still holding up beautifully.) The pan is the perfect size for a can of soup or vegetables or a gravy mix. I absolutely love it!"
"I had a lot of trouble finding this C D. I look over the internet for couple of hours until I came upon Amazon. Not only did I find what I was looking for, but bought the C D for a price I did not think could possible. Thanks! Love this Awesome C D."
I am a country music fan and have seen the movie many times. I wanted to read the book and I'm glad I did. It was enjoyable.
"Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film."
I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
"This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!"
"I don't have children yet, but my profession is a photographer, and with infants so little it's sometimes hard to get them in a perfect pose, the boppy is a great tool to get a natural look, you can cover it with a blanket to match whatever you want, so next time you go to get those special memories captured, bring along your boppy and introduce your favorite photographer to the boppy, ( i also prop it up a little if they are on a table, and the camera is fixed ie jcpenney or sears) Congrats to all and many smiles!!!"
Received the item and it is just like advertised. Purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so I can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee.Nice quality pitcher.
"The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names."
I bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use I am very disappointed. The pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non-stick surface is beginning to flake off. I always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils. The last non-stick pan I had was Kirkland brand and it lasted four years.
"Make sure its as tight as possible, otherwise the babies head can get inside and the baby could soffocate. The back/side should be totally covered in velcro so that you can stick the tabs where you need them"
"I'm a relative neophyte to skiing and bought this with the expectation that it might facilitate my learning. In my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money. Yes, it does provide a modicum of instruction, but for the most part it's suppose to be developing muscle memory by having you watch techniques being repeated ad naseum; didn't work for me.If you want some truly helpful instructional materials, look at the Lito Tejada-Flores and Harold Harb books and tapes."
"Something to always look foward to in a Sequal is the gameplay you loved from the first. That's the Great thing about OUtbreak 2, it has the same controls, but this time you can CHOOSE who you want to play with you. for instance, If David does not work well with Kevin, but works well with Jim, then you can choose Jim as your partner. Plus you can walk as you shoot! The only downside is that theres not going to be a Outbreak file 3 :("
"This book deals in stereotypes and caricatures. It ignores the example of Jesus Christ, and denies the exile status of God's predestined elect people. It begs the question continually by assuming that the ""responsible"" thing to do is to kill the bad guys. As in his book on hell and the immortality of the soul, there is no evidence of Morey carefully reading the literature of those he attacks.For a page by page refutation of this book, I recommend Richard Barber's ""Whenis it right to Fight? Never"", available from Pilgrim Brethren Press, po box 171, Petersburg, Ohio 44454. Barber is a sovereign grace pacifist, like me."
"I mean, this was never the greatest movie ever, but I own the other two so logically i had to have this one. Came quickly, shipped well, no problems...except the film itself...just....bad."
"this is not a dvd to watch! it is only audio music of brad paisley, with 2 stupid background slides. they are not even real photos, just digitally created. a big cheat if you expect to see somehting of brad paisley..."
"The DVD omits _all_ ambient noise in the movie, including Smaug's fire, his whooshing noise over the village, the arrows plinking, wolves howling, etc. It is very disturbing to those who are familiar with the video version, and if I could I would ask for my money back."
"I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years, and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre. Just an unbelievable classic. It feels weary and long at moments, also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul. Must have."
I purchased this rice cooker as a Christmas gift for my parents. I was looking for one that also cooked hot cereals or porridge. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. My parents loved it - my mom has Alzheimer's so my dad does all the cooking. He has become an expert at making great yummy hot cereals. Once my husband tasted the hot cereals he ordered a cooker for us as well. The cooker is very easy to clean! We are very happy with it. Ours is made in Japan
"Goblet of Fire, the movie, is an unacceptable hash. Sure, the original is a long book. Did the mercenaries running this franchise think perhaps to make it into two movies and sell them both? I understand that a film adaptation of a novel is an adaptation, not a copy in another medium, but it must still be a finished work in its own right. GOFtm is so disjoint and illogical and the progress through it so unmotivated that a fair amount of what happens in it makes no sense. It would be a complete waste of money even if the book did not exist. This is not a film but an insult. Slapdash, haphazard, chopped up exploitation. The cinematic equivalent of a Barbie doll."
"The workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course. VERY UNHAPPY. I wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software, but only to send it back. I need the workbook for my class, and the class is in its fourth week. I have since ordered the software from the manufacturer.Jim McShane"
"Three years after the apparent death of the striped sweater wearing madman, original creator Wes Craven comes back to bring more fear to Elm Street! But this time, the terror doesn't stop at the screen. This is a movie inside of a movie. Freddy's coming into reality because the movies have ended. I love the return of the original cast members,i love the Freddy character in this movie more than i have since Part 4 because he's actually kind of frigtening again,and i think that the story is well executed. I commend you Wes Craven! But on a sad note, i miss the old Freddy look and i most certainly miss the ""what the hell?"" reaction i got watching the originals. Reality sort of complicates things. But hey, i like the movie... alot."
"it's not the kind of music u can listen to every day , but his playing is awesome , something to marvel !!"
the book covers very detailed instructions for the beginners to understand and follow the psychic healing.i have yet to practice and experiance the process
"Ok it was pretty derivative, although I admit I never clued in on the Star Wars similarities until I read some reviews. And the writing was pretty pedestrian. But I did enjoy it and that has to count for something. A good introduction to the genre for young readers? yeah I think so."
"I've seen better movies on The All News Channel. Odysseus was played very well, but his part was boring. As well as the rest of the movie. Scylla looks like 1930's cartoons.I drew better stuff in 1st grade.Every single scene looks so fake it isn't even funny. I can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm. I would not recommend this to anyone young or old. This movie isn't worth a penny in my book!"
"I purchased this phone for my 90 year old mother who wears two hearing aids. Not only can she finally hear me on the phone, but she can use it while keeping her hearing aid in her ear. She has not heard this well on the phone for over ten years. I highly recommend this product."
"I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book. Every time I picked it up, I fell asleep. I had to read it for school, and it took forever to get here when I ordered it. Barely finished it in time."
"This book does not serve as a tutorial to learn assembly; rather it goes into many uses of assembly, such as reverse engineering, and protection from a virus. If you know assembly already, and want to use it more effectively, this would be a good book"
I am enjoying its use. The only issue is one of manufacturing. The opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. It is difficult to move the control. I modified the case by making a small cut to it.
"this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON'T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE. HOPEFULLY IN OTHER WORDS POOR DESIGN EXCUTED WITH SUB STANDARD PARTS."
"Although not an exciting read, this book should greatly interest the die-hard cigar aficionado and the botanist alike; it contains wonderful photographs and information on traditional and newly developed tobacco varieties, diseases, processing and cultivation."
"Saw these guys open for Butch Walker in Boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set. Since I liked what I heard I picked up the album. Good stuff, give it a listen."
"The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a ""forest"" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight."
"A bit simplistic at times, but got some good discussions goingin our Sunday School class (Methodist). Would recommend itfor Contemporary Adult Sunday School classes or Bible studies."
"If you already own ""An Evening with John Denver"" (five star album) then you don't need this one! The same program (exactly) has been repackaged with a new title and cover...less the two best songs! ""Boy From The Country"" and ""Today""...the original is fabulous but why do it again?!?!?"
"I love this product it's awsome. I have to admit it is painful a little the first time, but after that the pain goes away. you'll love the feeling of your skin after you use it, very smooth and clean. I totally recommend it."
"I borrowed this movie from my brother (thank goodness I didn't pay anything, even to rent it) and found it to be quite stupid. I love movies like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Bill & Ted, and this is no where close to any of these. Contrary to other reviews, the only funny parts I found were the tatto scene (saw it 100 times in the commercials, but still laughed at it, when he draws it out--""Suuuuuweeeet! What does mine say?"") and the bubble wrap parts. The Chinese restaurant scene was so not funny it actually made me mad.It gets two stars from me because I saw it for free after a long day with a sick child where I jsut wanted to get away from reality for a hour or two--it did accomplish that, but only minimally."
"I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it, and this was an unusual amount of time."
"I love it, it's LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn't get hot! It's wonderful!"
"Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear."
"The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it."
"Not another one again! I just don't understand Mr Grisham's maniacal obssesion with juries. Who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written? All I know is this: I'm sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries! The Runaway Jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that Grisham has poured from his stinking pen. Why does he think the average Joe is interested in judicial matters. I, for one, am not."
Just buy this album. 'Dry the rain' is the best song ever. 'Dog's got a bone' is close to being the best ballad ever. Each song is as original and unexpected as an earthquake. Push it out. Feel the Beta vibe.
I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down. The heroine - Gillian - was full of courage and didn't back down when faced with problems. Laird Buchanen - the hero - is all man - but you can feel how much he cares for Gillian. At the same time - there are 3 or 4 other storylines taking place that culminate in the resolution of Gillian's main problem - will she get to see her sister? does she find the treasure? how will she get Alec to his home after he is kidnapped? who is the traitor to the Sinclairs? and more! I read this book in 2 sittings - and it left me feeling happy!
"I found this book to lack depth and explanation. It vaguely lists certain herbs and plants that are of a healing nature, but the true content I was looking for was not here. I wanted more in-depth remedies for particular ailments, where this book applies certain remedies to a very hazy and small range of problems. I was also looking for a guide to ritualistic traditions rather than unmeasurable herbal concoctions."
When I purchased this cd I did not know what to expect. I have been a Billy Joel fan for my whole life. I was very surprised during the first listen. Even though it sounded something like Frank Sinatra would write it still has the Billy Joel feel. Both with the music and timing. As this fan grows older this is a welcome sound. I hope there is more to come. Joseph Leonardi
An absolutely inspirational book for the art quilter who prefers the art quilt to be based on historical blocks. A refreshing approach using patterns that are accurate and directions that are concise.
This book was one of the most boring books I've had to read in a long time. I found the writing to be unimaginative and felt like the book had no direction. I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished.
An oft time time spooky alternative history of a world where the Cuban Missile Crisis ended in war.The story of a newpaper reporter while in the process of reporting on just another murder stumbles across clues to the biggest secret known. There are those that will pay any price to keep him from unraveling the truth.
"Although at first glance the book seems to have a good plot, it does not. I didn't like the character of Patty, she seemed so pathetic and she whined too much. The relationship between Patty and Anton is very disturbing, becuase Patty is weird about how she reactes when she is around Anton. The book disturbed me."
"The original Patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies. George C. Scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors. I was happy to find this movie on Amazon on Demand, but was disappointed with the movie itself.-Looks like a low-budget made for TV movie which it is.-Casting was poor. Outside of George C. Scott these were a bunch of B or C actors. Richard Dysart as Eisenhower was particularly bad.-As noted in many other reviews, the video quality was poor.-Way too long and way too depressing.I was hoping this movie would cover more of the postwar Patton and less of George C. Scott lying in a hospital bed. If they cut off the last third of the movie, it might be four stars.I recommend you pass on this movie, at the very least stop watching after the accident. He suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies. There is nothing useful after that point and there is a LOT of overacting."
"I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as ""immature"" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection."
As one other reviewer mentioned finding great live CD's from new wave bands is very difficult. I'm usually not a fan of live CD's but I really enjoy this one. Autumnal Park is one of my all-time favorite new wave albums and I am excited that I get to continue to listen to it live.
"I loved this book. I seen the movie and have to say the book is so much better. I finished reading it then started reading it all over again. This was the first book I've read about Henry VIII and its inspired me to want to know everything I can about that time. Now I own over 30 books about Tudor history. I want to read everything I can get my hands on, and I never bore of it. And to think I owe it all to this book! It's from Mary Boleyn's point of view. You will see her challanges as well as Anne and the rest of their family. You will feel like your right there at court with them. It's an exciting and fearful time at the court of Henry VIII. It is also very accurate and I highly recommend it. Its one of Phillippa Greggory's better books. I've read all her books and this one is by far her best work. You will fall in love with the Tudor era if your not already."
"You should listen to this album many many times, like for a whole evening, sipping Martinis or Margaritas or whatever you like to drink. It's one of their greats, along with ""Some Girls"", ""Exile on Main Street"" and the others. This one is notable for the funky guitars, the jazz influence, and Keith Richards sounding like he's singing in Humphrey Bogart's bar in ""Casablanca"". Most importantly, this album appears to have been very carefully made, with a tremendous shot of inspiration, and it gets better every time you hear it."
"I think it is a hit or miss on this product. I have a friend that has a Playhut and it is fine. We just opened ours and at least 6 seams are coming undone (not sewn correctly), there are a couple holes in the material, 2 forgotten attachment loops, and it is rather flimsy. Kids still like it, though it isn't going to last too long."
"Purchased Book thinking it was the U.S. version of the book, but received the International version (""NOT to be used in the U.S."" according to the cover of the book). To date, the book mirrors the U.S. version exactly page for page, question for question. My only comment would be that the book is biased towards a U.S. view. I thought this was quite strange for an ""International"" management book and the ""International"" version no less. Some sections and stories appear to speak more negatively about other counties and paints the United States in a more positive light. It was my assumption that a book dealing with International subjects would be more objective and state the factual differences and similarities to managing in other countries and cultural differences."
"this album is a must have. look for the similarities between sunny day and jane's addiction in 100 million - i swear it's there. every track is incredible - be warned that listening to it in already-sad states will lead to probably more sadness, but it's good to be there sometimes."
"This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better."
"I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend. Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck. We tried everything but nothing would happen. The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one. The next one we received at least turned on. We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on. Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing. My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck. I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems."
"I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation."
"This laughing calin doll is perfect for young toddlers. She is small and light enough to be carried around easily. Her expression is very pleasant. She is the perfect ""play Mommy"" doll. She appears very well made and durable."
"After reading some of the reviews I see that there seem to be two sets of camps regarding this book: folks either loved it or hated it. I guess I'll have hang out with the haters. Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant, immature little princess. It's a good idea: a year cooking from Julia Child's French cooking book but it's just so hard to read. The whole thing is snark and whine and it tiresome after a few chapters."
I didn't care for this product at all. I found that it dried out my hair and was also very sticky. I will not purchase again...
Awesome guide! The best as finally been put out for a reference price guide on the best ever movie star MARILYN MONROE! Even she would be amazed I bet! Terrific job! Thanks for all the hard effort in making it! All worth it!
"I am sure the story is fine, but the disk is imperfect, lost my packing slip and need to call to return it."
"Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."""
"Walt Whitman's literary reputation has been hyped by ""gay"" critics (I suspect). I'm not totally hostile to free verse; in fact, I like T.S. Eliot, the most famous proponent of this genre, but Whitman wrote ramblingly, seemingly devoid of poetic coherence that the reader's creative imagination is left unstirred. I agree with Robert Frost, the truly great American poet, that writing poetry without the classic, conventional rules is like playing tennis--with no net."
I love this sauce whisk. It's comfortable to hold while whisking and easy to clean. I highly reccomend getting one for yourself.
"I was so excited to get this book. I wanted to make almost everything in this book because it was all so cute. However, I couldn't get the patterns to work. I looked up the ""errata"" page on the book's website, and it still didn't work. There are so many errors in this book that I can only successfully complete one pattern (for the granny square afghan). I loved the driving gloves, but the pattern is so incorrect, I never could finish them.I do not know if EVERY pattern has errors. The problem is that I don't trust the patterns to be correct, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out if they are correct just by looking at them. Perhaps if you are a true expert in crochet, you can figure out how to fix the pattern problems on your own. However, this book just sits on my shelf unused, because I'm not going to buy the yarn and spend hours working on a project I can't finish."
"I have these in the corner of my daughters nursery with various little things on them (vase of flowers, framed photos, my first mother's day card) and they are nice and strong. I painted them the color of her accent wall and they really pop. They paint easily and install even easier. A good purchase... would be great in a bathroom to keep little necessities at hand."
"I bought this heater and it didn't even work on arrival. The pilot light came on, but nothing else. What a waste of time and money."
Nice explanations as to why you learn the words in the way that you do and all books in this series include notebook client pages for you to take notes or practice the exercises. I liked the fact that he included questions of the class and his answers to those questions.
"This is a terrific recording. Rob Brown is simply one of the most interesting alto saxophonists playing today. A keening, strident tone with an attack that is relentless; he takes his time building momentum and surprises with twists and turns but never loses his footing. When you play this recording it is difficult to do anything else but listen; it is that captivating.Lou Grassi and Wilbur Morris don't just sit in the back seat for this ride. They compliment the leader and provide idiomatic support all the way through.It is an amazing ride and one that I will continue returning to. Rob Brown is one of a small handful of players who always provides the goods. All of his efforts are worth investigating. If you can find this one, it's a real jewel."
"I wonder, does a person have be seriously ill to write such a powerful book like Orwell did... He had no hope and he imagined all world in his situation. That's very interesting"
"batman begins is the best movie of 2005!christine bale stares in this movie and hedid a wonderful job doing it!this movie is about how bruce wayne turns to batman.he trains to be a ninja in asia and then founds that gotham city is flooded over with crimanels.so bruce wayne has to turn into batman to kill his very first villan, the scarcrow who could destroy poeples minds into panik!this movie is awsome!"
"Too slow, not much going on. I couldn't even finish it. There was no character study, no plot that I could see, nothing. I kept waiting for something to happen or for something to mean something or to see if there was any direction in it. Maybe it was just me, but I don't get it."
"I believe this is one of the top 10 over-hyped films in recent years--enough hype to garnish a Best Picture from the self-lauding Acedamy. In all of the two hours of so-called ""honor"" ""courage"" and ""loyalty,"" all I seem to get is bad acting, a contrived story, and fast-moving scenes. It reminds me of eating a large vat of buttered popcorn, a big box of jujubees washed down with a 64 oz. soda--fills you up, but no nutrition."
"This is the DEFINITIVE Count Basie + Williams album! IT DOES NOT get any better than this!Of special credit:""Everyday"" <--Easily the best arragement--EVER!""Please Send me Someone to Love"" <--Ditto.etc etcBUY ITLISTEN TO ITLOVE IT!"
"Originally I purchased this book because my Granddaughter's name is Sophia and I know how little ones enjoy stories that include their name. But I would purchase this book for a little one just because it is a good book. The pictures are bright and bold, the text right at the level of a preschooler AND it opens up to display a long train! A fun book to read together!"
I made the mistake of seeing this movie in the theater tried hard to get my money's worth. It was impossible. The dialog was so contrived and mindless. There was not a laugh to be had and the chemistry between Kinnear and Holly was nonexistent.
I love this movie so much. I have been watching it for years and I have yet to grow tired of it. It is a great movie with beautiful songs and music. The story-line will capture you. This is definately one of MY favorite movies.
"This production need not be limited to ""ever made for TV."" This is one of the greatest and most profound movies ever made. Every element of every scene is superb and riveting. I watched it again, twenty years after first seeing it, and enjoyed it even more with my Southern Baptist wife who kept insisting ""let's watch just one more episode""!This story is esentially Catholicism talking to itself through both the main characters and the sheer majesty of the Brideshead Estate (Castle Howard). This work is epically and evengelically Catholic. Anyone who sees ""Brideshead Revisited"" will find his tongue stopped about pedophile priests and ""Hitler's pope"" because his mind has been slowly, platonically wrestled around to see the glory of God's church on earth. Waugh is a midwife first, author second; and I would say the same of Mortimer, who made this production happen. Thank God for both men and for this production."
"Great movie filmed in New York, directed by Matt Thompson and written by Kent Moran. Scenes were filmed with the 'Red Cam' so it feels like you're right there with the actors. It's a great story about a high society deaf girl (controlled by her mother) and an ordinary 'Joe' (who works for a living) who fall in love. His dream is music and so is hers, even though she can't hear. Make sure to have your tissue ready for it will tug at your heart and the tears will come.It has won many awards in the film festivals throughout the US, one which was 'Best Director' at the Beverly Hills Film Festival.It's another Love Story movie worth watching."
"I have tried to watch this movie several times on TV, but always either miss the beginning or have to stop watching it before it's over. I was so glad to find this available in DVD. I was able to watch it in its entirety, without commercials. It's a very good movie. I highly recommend it."
"Philbrick takes the reader on a journey like no other, and explains each wave along the way. I couldn't put it down. I had a special interest in that my great-great-grandfather was a whaling captain (""Master""), and traveled those waters with my great-grandfather as a toddler on board. My one criticism of the author's perspective is what he didn't critique - cannibalism! I know it is easy to point fingers when I was not there, starving and dying of thirst, but the author went too far in the other direction and became their justifiers, based on the accounts of two survivors who chose to eat their friends. Why was there not a serious discussion about chosing to die with dignity rather than deify life at the cost of eating and drinking your friends? Perhaps the men who died earlier did hold to this. Why was that not a significant part of this work?Nevertheless, thank you Nate Philbrick for a book that should be made into a movie, with some of this balance."
I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton and his music dating from the Yardbirds forward. He's done a tremendous body of work. Unfortunately you won't find much here worth buying. The overall content and quality are pretty poor. Rather than masterpieces this more like the stuff left (for good reason) out of many other DVD's covering his work.
"This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child, grew rock formations in a fish bowl."
"You can dance, groove, bob your head and be touched emotionally all in one sitting. This CD simply rocks!"
The Harry Potter movies are great! My favorite is the Goblet of Fire. It has a lot of action in it other than the to be expected. It was closer to the book than I expected.
"I bought this despite the bad reviews because I thought it was impossible for an Anne movie to be that bad, but they managed to pull it off. Not only do they burn down Green Gables but they create chemistry between Anne and another man while things with Anne and Gil are cold. Come on people...all we want is a good chick flick with a nice ending!!"
"A very moving and informative book. A friend gave me this book shortly after my father passed. After reading it it made me realize what my father went through when he was in WWII. This book helped me bring me closer to my father.This book is full of stories of WWII vets, what happened to them, and how it changed there life, and how they succeeded."
"We are really enjoying this puzzle, and learning a lot. The information written on the oceans makes the puzzle more interesting and manageable.The pieces are necessarily very small to match the size of the countries. The bigger problem is that they curl up just a bit, so the pieces don't lie flat as you make the puzzle. This is frustrating, and you don't get that satisfying feeling as you put a piece in, as you have to press it down a few times and it still doesn't quite flatten down. I'm trying covering the finished puzzle with heavy books, but I suspect it's just a problem of cheap glue.Still, I give it four stars since a good world puzzle is very hard to find, and the content is good."
the inheritence series is a great series to read. i loved every word in it. Also read the next 3 books
"This is a PowerPC game. Up through Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Intel Macs had ""Rosetta,"" a technology for running PowerPC binaries on Intel machines.Apple discontinued Rosetta in Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), so there is not way to run this game (or any other PowerPC binaries) without emulating earlier versions of Mac OS X, or booting an earlier version on your Mac (which might not be possible with machines released after Lion). So do not buy it unless you are familiar with these issues.Caveat Emptor."
"OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card."
"Remember the days when Pearl Jam was good? back in good-ol-days with nirvana and other grunge bands.This was a valient effort from a once good band but thats all it was an effort. I hate to break the news to everyone but Pearl Jam is dead, and this cd ceartainly isn't helping bring them back from the dead.Save your memories of pearl jam, when they were good, and save your Money."
"It's funny, I can never figure out the music business and MTV any more. This is the most overrated, overhyped album I have ever heard, and yet they talk about it like it's gods gift to music fans. I admit there are a couple of tracks on this album that I like, but the rest forget about it. Being a somewhat introspective person myself, I understand that this album is a personal expression of sort, but where is the melody on most of these tracks? I love soulful, heartfelt music as much as the next guy, and I think maybe some other artists out there can learn that from Lauryn; however there isn't much else in this album. I think Brandy is much better than Lauryn, but doesn't get nearly the credit she deserves."
"This vest was just as described and the fit was great. It has wide shoulders so the comfort is good. Since I had never used a walking vest, I wanted to start out as recommended with lighter than 10 pounds so removed some of the weights. These were not so easy to get out of the pouches but that means they are securely held in place. I am well pleased with this GoFit walking vest."
"Considering the price of this card, its hard to be disappointed. I installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of Windows XP. As I write this, I am watching an old episode of Star Trek TNG on a small screen on top of AOL. The capture feature works great and the the additional goodies...from cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional. I never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware, and the 8500DV was no exception. There is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install... I have found it reduces many hassles. Speaking of hassles, I have had none with this card. Windows XP is such an improvement for handling complex components like the 8500DV, I would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out Win 98 system. This card costs about the same as a prime 3D gaming card. It provides dramatic capabilities. ATI has really done a great job with this card. For the price....it cannot be beat."
"Eric Flint has become an established SF Author. However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais, Cervantes, Voltaire, Swift and Sterne. This book set in ""Joe's World"" is the second book in this series. Although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading. Once read I was hooked into asking ""where is the rest of this story"", this is quite normal for this style of writing and I await eagerly the next volume."
"I like baby dolls, but not this one. I love Phoebe and Roxxi, so maybe I would get the big baby versions of those, but no other big Bratz babyz. This doll is not soft, so so much for hugging and cuddling it. It's kind of cute, but I would get big baby Phoebe and Roxxi only.As for your FALSE LIES about Barbie, people are still buying them, Mattel HAS NOT given up, and Barbie will still be aroundfor years to come! I love both Barbie and Bratz and nothing willchange that!"
"I am a huge fan of John Grisham, have read all of his books, but I have to admit, I have been disappointed with his last few books and The Last Juror takes the cake in that department. It has a great plot, but Mr. Grisham goes no where with it. It starts off very strong, but half way through and all the way to the end, it is awful. I found myself skimming through the pages asking myself ""what in the world does this have to do with the story?"". Any Grisham fan out there should read it just to read it, but do not expect anything that Grisham's potential has to offer."
The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
"This movie hurts me to watch it. Steven Segal gets shot up, put in a coma, and then he goes off killing people for revenge. The action is really cheesy, the plot is awful, and the one liners make you want to shoot Segal. Steven Segal can't act.Notice how his movies all seem to have three words ""Above the Law"" ""Hard to Kill"" ""Straight to Video""....oops.There is a quote in this movie after Steven Segal shoots at a guy's crotch. ""I missed. I never miss. They must be smaller than I thought."" This line was a mess up, the correct line is: ""I missed. I always miss. I must be lamer than I thought.""If you wish to suck seven years off of your life, then go ahead, otehrwise steer clear."
"This book is a master piece. This was the best book I ever read and I should know I'm only 13 but I've read more than my share of books. This should be turned into a movie, Brian of Boruma makes William Wallace look like a child. And if they're lookin for somebody to have a small part like Turlough I'll gladly play the part."
"After spending several weekends installing & re-installing this product on my XP Pro box, to use with its sister product (Belkin F5D6130 AP), I GAVE UP. Included CD was flakey -- so, got new driver from Belkin website. Installed & worked -- until I rebooted, then XP froze up. Had to disable an XP service (SSDP Discovery). After reboot, USB device is recognized, but offline, and cannot bring online. I have extensive experience with networking (20 years). Tech support was of no help. Could be an XP problem, but note: Belkin Driver is ""unsigned"". Avoid this product (for XP) until Belkin releases a better XP driver. Going forward, I will be looking for a wireless Ethernet bridge, possibly LinkSys WET11."
"I organize all my files into folders. However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover, there is no easy way to create a playlist. To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer. All playlists editions must be done in the same computer. This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers (home, office, notebook,...). I haven't bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations. Futhermore, the software that comes with it is terrible, much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player, and if you don't want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer, you SHOULD NOT BUY this device."
Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 Diapers Economy Pack Plus 246 CountI'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE BUYING THESE DIAPERS. I thought it is a good deal and i can save some money. but when i received these pampers baby dry diapers i opened the box and i find out that all of them has a little tiny brown stain on the back. since it was the first time i got these diapers i guessed it shoud've been this way so i put one on my 1 month and half baby girl. when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked. her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far. i put several pastes and cream to treat it. it took almost 2 day to get rid of them finally. she had been using this particular diaper like for 2 hours and for this little time it caused this terrible reaction. i dont understand how can people sell such a product especially baby stuff has to be carefully examined. do not repeat my mistake. NEVER BUY these diapers !!!
This is my favorite novel of all time. I have read and re-read it since I was a teenager. Frank Herbert was an absolute genius. Science fiction is not usually my favorite genre of reading but this is the exception. I have the entire collection of Dune books including the rare Dune Encyclopedia. A must read!
"Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume, let alone all four. An editor would have been useful but perhaps the publisher figured enough people would keep paying for the whole series that no editing was needed."
"I wouldnt call this a literary masterpiece or the best book that I have ever read, but I found it to be one of the most demanding--that I go back to it and finish as soon as possible!It's one of those literary candy novels that you can't put down. You will be up at night trying to find out who is sleeping with whom and killing whom next...The amount of sex in the book (without too much graphic detail) is numbing afterwards. It's almost as mundane as brushing one's teeth, after reading hundreds of pages on the role that sex plays in politics, weath, class, manipulation, etc.A harlequin story.Unbelievable society that Tudor was.So glad that women have it much better these days.The PILL did change history!"
"If you thought Bleed's debut was hot, your gonna get roasted to this. ""My Own"" has a different sound than his first record, but that's what makes it great. He uses lots of samples from the 70's giving it southernplayalistic style that's unmatched. The message conveyed through his lyrics is more than just a mission about money and cheese and thuggin'. Ghetto celebrities Too Short and Daz found their way onto this record, but they are an afterthought. The narcotic effect of Bleed's southern drawl and story telling ability that spawned his first record just accelerates on My Own. Get this if you want to ""listen"" to a message, not just ""hear"" words."
"What can one say about this book that has not been said before...it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read, which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in."
This is what should be coming out of Hollywood now! This film from 1973 is thought-provoking and truly entertaining without any silly special effects to blur the meaning!
"This is far and away the best book I've found on VB.NET. It is well written, and offers excellent perspective on VB.NET and .NET Framework, with enough detail so that the reader (together with some hands-on experience) will have a good depth of knowledge when he's finished. Highly recommended!"
"There are already over twenty reviews of this movie at this site, but I had to put my two cents worth in.Gaslight is the earliest of Bergman's works I have seen.We know from studies on facial expression and nonverbal communication that the face is difficult to read because of the rapidity of movement of the many features of the face...eyes, mouth, checks, chin. But I swear, watching this film makes me believe that Bergman could command the movement of her hair folicles and skin pores. There are facial movements in this film that absolutely cannot be seen with the naked eye. It appears that she has not moved a muscle yet she has conveyed a powerful emotion.That's why Bergman must be in the top ten actresses of all times.The story was good, but watching Ingrid was superb!"
"I love this whole movie! I is my all time favorite. I am not really a movie goer but this is one that I have played over and over again and never get tired of it.""Corprate Account Payable, Nina Speaking ...Just a moment!""I have been in a cube most my life and so much rings true....this is a celebrated movie and a tribute to all of us that work in the corprate world!I happen to like me work, getting there was a struggle...we all have been Peter Gibbons at one point or another in our career!""Hey Peter....Watch you Corn$%#""There are so many lines from the movie that just make me laugh. I know the budject for the movie was 10Mil..and I knowthat opening week it did 4mil...10 mill total...but the DVD is a cult classic...it must be reeling in the bucks!"
"I have to give them a negative-10! the add clearly says a 6pack so I ordered 5 sixpacs and the only sent me 5 rolls! Clearly false advertising! I even orderd some for my sister! What a rip off! Don't order from them!!!!!!!!!!!!Plus the shipping of $8 that is a RIP OFF!!!!!Scotch Sealing Tape, 1.88 x 54.6 Yards, Clear, 6 Pack (3690)"
Waiting for the World to End to me was a very interesting novel. I thought that the book was a lot different from other books I have read in the past. The ending was not what I had expected but it was unique. Waiting for the World to End related to real life situations and controversial issues. The book showed that not everyone is perfect and everyone does make bad decisions in their lives. The book gave me faith and let me know that when life is bad to just hang in there.
"Come on....the number of errors.I made the capelet twice, even though the ending stitch count wasn't what it should have been due to the pattern error. An intermediate crocheter would simply know to make increases (or decreases if appropriate) and move along. A beginner may just be frustrated when it doesn't turn out as it should.Then there was the beanie pattern that I basically ""winged"" and made from memorizing other beanies that I'd made before.The fashions are cute and inspiring but very basic and can probably be found for free on the internet."
I was hoping the songs were the original recordings by the original artists. Little Darlin is not the hit recording by the Diamonds. I don't know which group is singing but it's the wrong one. Disappointing.
...of one of the oldest mysteries in England was thoroughly enjoyable. The story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery. Until I read another theory on these two little princes I find more believable I'll stick with this one!
"Bought it and was a bit disappointed. I thinkthat Clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he's not. The songsjust didn't do it for me.Certainly not the Clay Aiken that sold platinumwith his first CD. Wonder how that happened???????Spend your money of something worth while, butif you just got to have it, burn yourself acopy from a Clay fanatic who is sure to havea few extras on hand."
"I have to say that I am a pretty big Kurt fan. I was excited when this movie came out because I felt it might actually be pretty good. The only good thing I can say about this movie was that the actor looked semi-like Kurt, and thats it!! It was a def. bummer and I had to pull myself through it!! I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone!! Hes a great artist with a great band! The legend should be left to rest in peace!! Kurt's probably turning in his grave over this. If you have ever read anything about him you would know this is not what he would have wanted!! All in all take my word for it, this is a waste of money and time!!"
"Great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind. John Douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method: look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it. This is in contrast to the approach of: identify a likely suspect, then identify facts of the crime that fit the suspect. The author does not claim to solve all of the cases he studies in this book, but rather point us in the right direction. For example, he describes the likely personality characteristics and behavior of Jack the Ripper (interestingly this does not seem to match Patricia Cornwell's conclusion) and the Zodiac. His discussion of the Ramsey case is probably the most controversial since he was personally involved in the case. A well written and interesting book."
"I bought this Bible as a gift, and I was completely thrilled with it. It is small enough to carry with you but large enough for at home study. The print was larger than I expected, and the pages were not too thin. The cover work was very nicely done; my friend was very pleased with this Bible!"
"I'm not sure why this movie has gotten good reviews. It was not good. The dialog was awful, the plot ridiculous (we have to destroy it in order to save it). I wish Liam would stop taking on mentor roles.The final scene was physically impossible (swinging under the train as it was moving. just ask yourself how he swung past the pylons that held the rail up)"
"I, like a lot of people writing reviews, play a lot of first person shooters. If you liked Splinter Cell, buy TRAOD USED!!! I agree with everyone here...story is good, controls are less than mediocre. Even Enter the Matrix blew this game away. Customizing the keyboard helps some, but less than what I expected. I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS, but to no avail. Hopefully, if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer. And for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc, I can assure you that is NOT the case."
"These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy."
"Well, a lot. More than a lot. Poor Will does his best with a doggie script. He accounts for the one star.I don't know why those enlightened movie companies insist in making one SF dog after another. Did you watch the ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", ""Sky Captain"", or ""AvP""? There are plenty of others around, all of them sucking money out of our pockets.They need to fool us in order to pay for the great CGI effects I suppose. They fail to understand that if CGI is used to generate profits, it will kill the emotional content of the movie. What's left is the customary Hollywood Pablum dulling our senses.Do not relate this dog to any of Isaac Asimov's works. They stole the title and we shall punish them by forgetting this miserable mutt."
"For those of us that are more logical and analytical in our thinking, CS Lewis illustrates logically the need to not only acknowledge but address the existence of God but make a choice in where we stand and what we consider Truth. Use this as a starting point in a lifelong journey to gain an accurate picture of who God is."
"In my opinion, this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage. My five year old was in TEARS because we could only find five second clips of actual skating. To make matters worse, there doesn't seem to be anyway to access the actual skating events, even if one is willing to pay for it. Nor does the Olympic website itself have videos of the events. I could understand if we were searching the week of the Olympics, or even that month. However, it's been close to a year. SHAME ON YOU NBC. The Olympics are not yours."
"These are good diapers that don't leak, even with overnight soakings. They don't hold up to blowouts as well as huggies little movers, however."
Excellent classic style movies. All well acted with excellent stars. Will watch over again many times.Colin Firth is one of my favorites.
"gibbons weaves a compelling, influencial novel about three generations of women and the lives they lived and their impact on one another. detailed first person through Margaret birch's eye, this story tells of margarget's coming of age during world war 2. the book tells of margaret's mother (who constantly strives to be young and stylish and concequently is quite irresponsible)and her grandmother (a self-proclaimed doctor who always seems to have the right answer as well as unconditoinal love for her grand daughter) with whom she lives. in a dramatic ending, margaret realized that she has to move on from her sheltered home-life and must learn to face the world on her own two feet."
"Well this movie started off semi-enjoyable. An early shower scene of Reese Witherspoon made me happy. Thie movie sets up with a father-daughter conflict that you've seen in hundreds of other movies. Enter Marky Mark, sweeping the girl off her feet. Then comes the part when the girl argues a lot with the father. And so on... we've all seen this before. It seems like the writer ran out of ideas at the end of the movie, though. Or perhaps he was getting bored with all the build-up he was creating with the characters that he was just like ""Alright, screw the rest of the plot, lets get to the action."" And so he does. And soon after the movie ends at a seemingly premature 1hr. 16min. Woohoo.Don't waste your money on this DVD, or even the rental, they play it all the time on USA or the like."
"After getting tired of looking for batteries for our other sharpeners, I decided to look for a sharpener closer to what I used in school. Well this one is not it. After three uses, the entire collection cup just came off and would not go back on after adjusting every way imaginable. In order to sharpen a pencil, the cup must be on securely and ours was just flat out broken. Also the pad on the bottom of the unit was very loose upon opening but we were still able to make it suction to our granite. Don't waste your money on this cheap plastic."
"I am still in shell-shock that people of quality such as Chloe Sevigny & Stephen Rea could even finish filming this piece of dog doo-doo, this thing is beyond horrid - there aren't enough words to convey how much this thing stunk! The movie starts out ok, steadily begins to make less & less sense, becomes just utterly non-sensical, and THEN takes a very sharp turn into pure absurd idiocy - and WAY over-the-top gore. NONE of it making any sense, mind you. NONE OF IT. Not the time structure of events, not the things taking place, and most assuredly not the moronic ending. I was quite angry that I'd spent $1.08 at my discount video to even rent it."
"I've got one of those and it was so cloudy that I was hardly able to see the lava. Plus the lava didn't move at all after several tries. I was very dissatisfied and returned the item, and got the same thing from directly Target's website. This time it's clear and works fine (though it takes about 2 hours to warm up, but I think it's normal for new lava lamps). So, I'm very happy with my new lava lamp. I don't know the reason, but I guess somehow Lava Lite doesn't have a good quality control on its products. If you're lucky you get a good one but chances are also high that you might get a dysfunctional one. So order it at your own risk."
"A great, comprehensive guide that helped me to understand why this happened in a historical context. Also helped me to get a better grasp of what to expect with the war against Afghanistan and Al Qaeda. Now I know why this happened and what to expect. The news media seems to breeze over historical elements in favor of status quo Anthrax and millitary events but this book really helped me to get caught up on my facts. Highly recommended!"
"This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!"
"I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare"
"Thank goodness for the Beta Band! I must say this album is a real treat for the ears- sonically broad, lyrically uplifting, and overall a good time for all. Kinda like if Graham Parsons spliced his genes with Beck Hanson, had a daughter, who then married David Byrne and had a mess of kids, thereby amounting to the Beta Band. Musically, it's that hard to pin them down, and that's a good thing. Definitely an album that can be enjoyed for ages on end- the only drawback I felt was the appropriately titled 'Monolith'. But hey everyone is entitled to their madness."
I am a fan of classic literature but this book was just too slow for me. Everyone should read it because it's a classic but I didn't enjoy it.
"I think that Ansel Adams was a great photographer, I personally love photography, and would love to see more professional photographers."
"The first two are wonderful but don't waste your time or money on the Continuing Story. It is awful, isn't even similar to the books and she does very un-Anne like things. Not worth it at all and very disappointing!"
"Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use, but adding air very easy."
"This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in the history of the Jewish Lower East Side in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is written by an author with intimate knowledge of the time and place. Written in 1917, it is a very captivating and compelling story of an Eastern European Jewish immigrant's plight on The Lower East Side. I highly recommend it."
"The first 5 songs are incredible, and the rest are OK. I live in France and Chumbawamba never got really big there so I haven't heard tubthumping a zillion times, which makes it still interesting to listen to."
"Sometimes one forgets the great singers of but a few years ago. This 1971 performance recording, made in Tokyo, though visually a bit dark, is acoustically sparkling with the singers' joy with Donizetti's music. He would surely loudly applaud this effort. Both Fiorenza Cossotto and Alfredo Kraus are at their peak. To say nothing of Sesto Bruscantini and Ruggero Raimondi in supporting roles. This opera, unfortunately, is often overlooked for the better known Donizetti works. Well worth enjoying as the music is grand, the arias are among his finest and the ballet a treat to see."
"This was pretty crap none of the kids like them and they are not amazing at all. My kids threw them in the trash first day, just a waste of money"
"These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from. I sent mine back!"
"I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended."
"I gave this a two star rating based on the fact that mine was to be used for a larger dog. This product would be adequate for a small dog. But the opening for a dog with a larger muzzle is not large enough. The claims for not spilling water seem to be true. However, since only about an inch of water is in the bottom of the opening at any time, it's more difficult for a larger dog to get his nose in and get a good drink. I guess if the dog were extremely thirsty and had no other water supply, this could do in a pinch."
I am a very satisfied customer. The shipment was received extremely fast! The hat is in perfect condition. No complaints. Thanks!
"If you have never seen this movie, PLEASE do. You won't regret it. Even though it was made in 1971 it has not lost any of the horror, humor, ultra violence or message. There is nothing dated about this movie, I wonder if Kubrick planned it that way. I far surpasses any movie on this particular subject that has been made since, really. Malcom McDonald should have won an Academy Award for his performance, he was perfectly cast."
You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?
"Es una lectura muy amena, para el que sabe un poco del idioma astrológico, sin embargo es fácil de leer, y el libro a diferencia de otros de SA está escrito de una forma más informal debido a que es tipo conferencias de pregunta y respuesta.Es un excelente complemento para el otro libro del mismo autor Person to Person Astrology."
...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explore it further...
"I have used many of the team challenges in this book in my work in youth ministry and public education. There are ideas for everything from ice-breakers to large group challenges that are very effective for building community and encouraging people to work together toward a common goal while having fun at the same time. While some of the ideas require more complex props, many can be done with items you have readily available around the house or office. All of the ideas would work as effectively with youth or adults in a variety of settings. Best of all, the text is written in Rohnke's witty style that makes reading about the games almost as fun as playing them."
"This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that ""hunt the tomorrow"" of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see..."
"Leaving the issues for apostates and apologists to bicker over, this book simply looks at the lives of people actually in the church: what they do in their normal every day lives. I especially liked the depictions of Latter-Day Saints in nations outside the United States, including the temple trip down the Amazon and a few shots of Victoria Peak! Beliver or no, these pictures tell 10,000 words about a people that are industrious, optimistic, and compassionate. These photos aver that while many continue to criticize and ostracize this church, the Latter-Day Saints frequently hold the moral/ethical highground on their idealogical opponents. How many other 200-year old American religions would stand under this kind of across-the-globe scrutiny? This book contains real, in your face, irrefutable evidence that like them nor not, the Mormons are indeed a ""peculiar people."""
I suppose this type of humor isn't for me as I barely cracked a smile throughout the course of the entire movie. This movie presents you with uncomfortable situations and expects you to laugh nervously.
"This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring! The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV, but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the TV back on. I mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with 4 wall TVs, robot dogs, and burning books. And the story never really had an ending. It just stopped, I guess to end the boredom. I think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book. How else would it get on the required reading list? Maybe he gives 50% of the profits from sales. Please don't buy this book, you are supporting a lunatic."
The author displays a complete disregard for the teachings of the Catholic Church (either pre-Vatican II or post-Vatican II)and instead offers recycled stereotypical nonsense of Catholicism offered by the same pseudo-religious Protestant preachers who seek to discredit the Church.One might actually gain a better knowledge of the Catholic Church by reading:a) The Bibleb) The Catechism of the Catholic Church(Something that the author of this book has obviously not done)
"I read ChiRunning in Sep 09. It took me 2-3 wks to get the form right while running. I've been ChiRunning since.It's not effortless - my heart rate meter tells me so - though it does feel effortless for a whole minute or two doing medium sprints. I now run 4x a week, an hour or two each time. This is something I'd never been able to do in the past because my knees always started giving problems and I'd have to train on an elliptical afterwards. The knees are fine now. I'm sure Danny wouldn't recommend it, but you can even run on a bad knee with this technique - I ran 10k on a poor knee without much loss of speed.My timing has also improved, though not as much as I'd hoped or expected (hence 4 stars).Enjoy running? You should give it a go."
"This DVD has VERY terrible sound and VERY low budget video footage. The only good thing is it has alot of songs, and the riot is somewhat interesting. Bad Religion is a good band, but this DVD is awful!! :(You will feel ripped off if you buy this!! Borrow it first, if you can, before buying it!!! I guess this DVD could always be used as an expensive cup coaster."
"I bought the 810 model, which is similar. Worked generally fine, but because of its shape, easy to drop or fall over. I put it on top of my desktop, and accidentally it fell on the wooden floor, and since then, it has not turned on. Too fragile."
"This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced. It was very confusing, especially the ""TV family"" which I did not understand at all. It is more of an adult book."
"I bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage. I expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom. However, I found the book very frustrating: 1)the testimonials all came from women who were dissatisfied with their relationships, neglecting those who developed strong bonds with stepchildren; 2)the advice is all too vague to be applied. Chapters titled, ""Simplify Expectations"" and ""Simplify Relationships"" are filled with generalizations that are about as effective as telling an over-stressed mom to ""just relax"". Overall, a disappointing read."
all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey. I only like the first song. the rest....are all CHEEZY!
I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items.
"Personally, I love everything Jane Austen ever wrote to BITS. But none of her works (except maybe the humorously offbeat ""Northanger Abbey"") can match the high standards set by ""Pride and Prejudice"". There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line. This is still a great novel, as witty and funny as ""Pride and Prejudice""--but it's comedy with a bit of a nasty undertaste."
"Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros, pero tiene un problema: da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama. Esta era una fantastica historia, sin embargo, no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje. Se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia: la historia de Eliza. No es que no me haya gustado, si me gusto, pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado. Me quede con las ganas de saber que paso despues. Se habra quedado con tao'chien? se habra reconciliado con Miss Rose? Eso nunca lo vamos a saber!"
"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective by Ibn Al-Rawandi (Prometheus Books) Any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one's beliefs. First it is always important to know other points of view, even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and life-saving. This book offers a critique of the Sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and self-deception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in one's views than to seek fantastical delusions. Now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in one's mysticism one should give such nay-sayers a careful hearing, concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view. Otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk."
"Bootleg collection of b-sides, remixes, and singles. Really, why even bother?"
I ordered and had to return two separate copies of this DVD because of wavy lines in the picture on both copies.
I bought this for my husband to be for Christmas. He grew up with the F Troop and wanted this. He loves it. I am very happy with my purchase. Great entertainment and it is CHILD SAFE comedy.
"This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump."
"I bought this book thinking this was Historical fiction...I was wrong, this is trash, one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read, he doesn't know squat, and his characters are ludicrous, badly written and boring."
"This course while extensive in activities, was not what I had expected. The course did not start out basic such as learning basic communication between two people. I think this course is better for someone who is some-what fluent in French already. In addition, this course is however good for refreshment or learning more where it comes to things such as ordering dinner or renting an apartment."
This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
"I only wish that more time was devoted to the natural beauty of Italy and its cities,towns and natural coutryside, particulary in the north, as opposed to horse racing, auto racing etc."
The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.
"Of course everyone knows that this album is a masterpiece. It's Lauyrn's greatest work. Regardless what people say about Lauryn Hill she is remarkable. She's like no other human being ya know. I love the Miseducation of Lauyrn Hill, this is my 5 time buying the cd, the first 2 times someone stole it from me and the other 2, I wore the cds out listening to them so much."
"If you want one book to do it all, get this one.At least it provides you with a vision of most of the issues surrounding infertility.It provides excellent information on female infertility issues.It provides cursory information about male infertility issues.We have recommended and loaned out this book to several friends, and they all were happy with the details provided."
"Having gone through the first 3 chapters of this book, I must say I am really dissapointed. The author is supposedly trying to avoid the mathematical rigor to the account of explaining things in a physical way. Well, he almost completely fails in that and, the worst, confuses the reader. For example, he devotes 15 pages to smoothly introduce the reader to the concept of a manifold, promising a more rigorous definition to be given later on. When the time comes, he uses two ""brand new"" concepts, namely Haussdorf space and countable base, for the meaning of which, the reader has to look up in other books!(however cited in bibliography) If one wants to understand what all these things (manifolds, diff. forms, Lie deriv, etc.) are about, the best thing to do is buy a mathematical book. After all, it is hardly possible to satisfactorily describe abstract mathematical concepts if you avoid using mathematical language! For the interested, I am NOT a mathematician."
"This book was a fun read. There are times that you can tell that the writer was in his mid to late teens when he wrote it, and other times that he writes far beyond what you would expect from someone his age. Excellent read that I would recommend to any fan of this genre."
This book had way to many characters! Is boring from start to end and has no point! What the hell does this book mean?
"Clear, simple, easy-to-read style. Many of the steps are obvious in retrospect. The book merely raises your awareness of the steps so you're more likely to use them"
"This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir, and it presents an interesting point or two, but everything in this film has been covered before, in better films."
"Dune is the best book I ever read. I know it is not a good argument to persuade you, but it is the only thing I can say. Read it."
I also do not know why they bothered with this limited edition gift set. The extra disk does nothing except waste your time.
"These guys are really a good match together. So funny and fun to watch with the family. I wish it had the Thin man, which for some reason I thought this had. But I ended up getting the Thin man collection later anyways."
Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.
A pure joy to watch with its many special effects. It is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
"My foot doc recommended I use this first instead of going in for surgery for a bunion. He told me to wear it for at least 3 months at night. So far, it's been about 3 months, and I do see a minimal difference with the severity of the bunion. I can wear a pair of narrow shoes now that I previously could not. It's not an overnight cure, but I would recommend this for anyone with a Stage 1 bunion issue. It looks cheap, but it's surprisingly durable! It may feel a bit uncomfortable for the first few nights, but you get used to it."
"I doubt this would have been published if Crichton weren't Crichton. Just a hodge-podge of stuff - medical school, a few good travel essays, a lot of paranormal stuff - energy balancing, auras, channeling, etc. etc. I see a lot of readers loved it, but I thought it was a waste of time."
This is exactly what was described and perfect! It fits right under the counter and is so easily installed. We searched forever to find a decent looking spout along with the water filter for under the sink and we finally found Aquasana!
"This book, The Family Under the Bridge, is about an old hobo named Armand. He and a family live in Paris.Armand the old hobo pushed all of his belongings around in an old baby buggy, that had no hood.One day Armand took the Calcet children, Suzy, Paul, & Evelyne to see Father Christmas.A whilr later, Armand took the children and their mother to a gypsy camp where they lived for a few days. But then the gypsys moved away and they were again homeless.And because Armand loved the children so much he got a job at the Halles. And while he was there he could picture the wholr family sitting and playing in the house.And until then they have lived happily ever after."
"Rather than comment on the film, I'll comment in the disc itself. Worthwhile set of extra features, but it's not an action film so the widescreen doesn't add much. A note on the 'Digital Locker' content: 1.you may not be able to view it. 2.it may lock up your browser. 3.the deleted scene is on the disc anyway. Summary: Buy it if you like Office Space, not because of the widescreen and Digital Locker content. BTW although it's zone 1 NTSC it played just fine on my zone 4 PAL DVD player."
"I must say that, even for Troma, this one was pretty bad. A plane crash leaves tourists stranded on a tropical island that happens to be the home base of a group of nasty terrorists. Now, think Troma: how would YOU work with this plot? Needless to say, there are MANY dead before it ends. I thought there was a limit to the amount of blood and guts one could put into a movie (and smear on a woman's breasts) untill I saw ""War"". The movie is rather low quality, not like some of the newer Troma releases, but if you like classic Troma, it dosn't get any more classic than this. Not one for the kiddies!"
"this movie totally sucks. i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money. the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened. the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole. thats it, the movie sucked dont buy it."
"This has always been one of my favorite movies. It is one of my favorite roles for all of the actors, especially Edward Norton, but they all did beautifully. It was refreshing to see Ben Stiller in a more serious, yet still comedic movie."
seemed like a nice heavy steel cap and would have worked great if they would have sent the rite keys for it! keys have serial number on them and cap has serial number on it they did not match! next time i will go to a store and buy it to make sure they keys are the rite ones!!!
"As a loyal fan of the Stargate franchise since the very first movie...I applaud the actors, writers and producers/director for a job well done!It still takes some getting used to a 'feature-length movie' vs 'made for television'; meaning I was so used to them getting right to it, that I had to learn how to sit back, relax and let the actors take me there.I can only say that I was very satisfied with this purchase and I have a little bit more of Stargate in my home...where it belongs.Thanks!DarrylCincinnati, OH"
"I LOVE this movie. It's powerful, action packed, and well...it just rocks. Great directing by ridley scott (legend, bladerunner, G.I jane, thelma & louise, Alien...), great acting by Russel Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Richard Harris. Great costumes, AWSOME score by Hans Zimmer, (i have the cd). This movie has everything: action, revenge, gore, romance, great CGI... well worth buying.You might have heard some discouraging remarks such as Gladiator not being historically acurate, but it isn't supposed to be. It's FICTION... its BASED on history, yes, but so is Braveheart...which is pretty unacurate, and you don't see people chasing down randal wallace with torches... (braveheart is a great movie too though).Now not only is the movie great, but the two-disk DVD is awsome. over 10 deleted scenes, 2 long featurettes, feature length commentary, great interactive menus, and a great addition to anyones DVD collection."
This is a close fictionalized movie of the beginning of WWII. It is interesting and a great flick to share.
Great to have a large capacity water container that is made to minimize spills. Good for travel and kennel recommend to all who travel.
"The actors in the movie are a great bunch, but when the plot is very weak, you dont get very much. I mean Liam Neeson! Hes a great actor, but was very weak in this movie. it wasnt scary at all, the the end of the movie was bad. There was maybe one scary part, which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump. That was all. I dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies, b/c it was a polar opposite."
"First of all, I am quite offended by this author. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist with 30 years of experience in the public school system. I am currently working as a special education coordinator in (heaven forbid) a public school system. I read about children and their issues/concerns/characteristics continuously. This book was recommended by a parent and I was very excited to read it. I was not prepared for the assault on speech-language pathologists and others in the public schools of America. I truly wish the author would do a more thorough investigation of our credentials and our job performances. We are not in the business of ""creating business"". Believe me, we have plenty to keep us busy. We are, however, very dedicated to children and their needs....whether that involves ""Einstein type children"", Asperger's, Autistic, Hyperlexic, Attention Deficit Disordered, Gifted or any of the multitude of diagnoses."
"A series of short vignettes about fencing, none detailed enough to impart and real knowledge. A definite lack of technical instruction on fencing. Not sure who this video would be useful for...certainly not a beginner trying to learn about the technical aspects of the sport."
"I bought this book thinking it was similar to the Harry Potter series (in nature and spirit) but I was very wrong. The characters are acceptable, but the author did a poor job of developing the Kit character... Also the writing is exceedingly dull, the story slogs along at an incredibly SLOW pace...Truthfully I found the story boring... but I read it anyway. I will not be reading the rest of the series.I think the writer's biggest mistake is trying to write the ""magic"" as if it were scientifically possible, and she spent way too much time trying to do so... Newsflash! Its MAGIC>>> you know fantasy, you don't need to make it or prove it... fantasy is simply a world that doesn't need explaining or proving.I think someone very young might like this book, but I did not. I am moving on to another series that has better writing."
perfect for frothing. well built product. would buyanother in a heartbeat.no more dribbles from a roundedged vessel i was using previously.
"Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music."
"You would have NO idea reading the description, and looking at the picture on the front, but most of these movies have a rating of PG-13, and there's even an R!!!They are mostly about sex, sensuality, and the like.Yuck. I bought this because my daughter likes the historical movies like Pride & Prejudice and Emma, etc...These are NOT the same. I threw the set away without even opening it. The ratings are on the back. They should be written on the page."
"The Joy of OrigamiThis book is colorful and seemed promising for a beginner to self teach. The diagrams maybe okay if you already know what they are suppose to look like at each step, but as a teaching aid they compare to teaching American children from a hieroglyphic test. I bought another book on the same subject to help get through the simplest basics, but it was only marginally better. Van Sicklen is not a beginner's writer. This book could easily drive people away from the art through frustration."
This is a fun movie for children. My sons watched this too many times when they were 4-6 years old and I am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey. I know that sounds corny but it is true. My oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school & club. Good clean movie. I bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game. Hopefully it will impact them like it did ours. GO DUCKS!
"For a history book, the research and footnotes were not very substantial. Historians have been getting a lot of negative publicity lately for less that exemplary scholarhip. Since this is not a very important book it will not be scrutinized the way Doris Kerns Goodwin or Joseph J.Ellis would be if they were to write about Florida. I felt like someone was snearing at me throughout the book. It seemed more like a big long blog. I'd love to read more about Florida history since so many friends live there now, but I truly hated this book."
"I am sorry but after reading this book, I have to admit that the feminists are right. Men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make money.The book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet. It actually only helps you find the love of your night. If I had actually used any of the tips in the book, I would have had alot of sex but I doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible. In fact I doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate, it would be inspite of the tips not because of them.An entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women, though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types, then the list over 10 to watch out for.I am glad I did not actually pay for this, I would have demanded my money back."
This book was so boring... It could have been a lot more effective if it was shorter and more to-the-point.
"I loved ""The List of 7"", but this book pales next to it, and is a disappointment. The characters and story are good. But Sparks' fall from grace and the things he does during it are disappointing and I think unnecessary to the story. It takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. This is not a book I will read again."
"Not Made in the USA! MADE IN CHINA!I just received my order and these are not made in the USA they were made in CHINA... I ordered two each of the following nozzles 573, 573TF, and 593. They are all made in China. I contacted Gilmour and they said that all their nozzles are made in China now. I purchased these as gifts as I have one that everybody loves, but it was made in the USA. I try very hard to do my part and buy American."
"When we purchased a new sofa that has a recliner on each end, we needed a table to sit in front of the middle seat when it's just the two of us. One that we could reach items from either recliner. This table has beautiful smooth wood; it's the right size & serves as the perfect companion when we settle down to a night of TV."
Item was just as described. Very nice fit...does not slip down your leg and also securely holds your weapon. I would definitely buy this again. Perfect
"I was excited to have the Earth's Children series available for my Kindle, but the OCR errors in ""Shelters of Stone"" make it almost unreadable. Surely SOMEONE must review the copy before the book is made available for sale? The quality of the story notwithstanding (the plot rather drags, as others have noted), it's incredibly distracting to come across so many mistakes in the text when trying to read the story. Publishers need to institute better quality control when issuing Kindle editions of old manuscripts."
"I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time."
"I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the ""scary"" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it's a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator."
"...you would have noticed how horrible the allusions are in this crap-that-calls-itself-a-movie. The characters were simply annoying; Telemakhos, the whiny school boy that cries whenever he doesn't get his way, creepy Athena, who's eyes are SUPPOSED to be gray, Penelope, who obviously has a more pleasureful time on the water on the beach than with her husband, and of course Odysseus, who would make me weep if he was my captain. The sets looked as if elementary school kids put them together, Scylla was a sock-puppet, and the shades were just sad. I have never in my life seen such crap and I hope you won't fall for these other 4-star reviews that make me want to PUKE!"
Got this mainly for veggies. Works great and fast. Very pleased with it. It could be a little bigger but can hold 4-5 servings.
Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
"Muy buena adquisición, el producto llegó a mi oficina 4 días antes de lo estimado, en excelente estado. Sin duda compraría de nuevo."
"When I selected this book I was looking for a book I could share with young children, ages 5 years and up, to give them a glimpse of Nigeria, its people and culture. I liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professions/lifestyles in Nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions. For example, the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in Nigeria for such outfits. Other professional roles we see Nigerians in are: BAKER, DOCTOR, WOOD CARVER/CARPENTER, LAWYER, POTTER, BLACKSMITH and FINALLY THE TRADITIONAL NATIVE DOCTOR or HERBALIST who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties. All in all, it paints Nigerians as an industrious people, which is what we are."
"For those wondering, like myself, this DOES come in a discrete package. Now, as for the actual product? OMG I've never felt something like this before. This is my first official toy, and I am sooooo pleased! It's a little large, and kinda hard but that's okay. Works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price."
"While I applaud the kid's efforts and see a fine writing future for him, I must point out that this book is a regurgitation of every other major fantasy series to date. If it were not in fact his parent's publishing company I doubt he would have been published. The story itself is cute, but the writer is young and needs many more years of polishing before he can reach the standards of those authors he's parroting in this book. It's quite sad that there is nothing new in this book. I had hoped for better."
"I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible. Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE! And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using 1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money."
"I'm using this on a Win98SE PC to connect to an Apple AirPort Base Station. It sees the base station fine, but when the Belkin is touching the base station it transmits at 70% signal strength. My PowerBook can see the base station at 100% one floor up, 80% on the second floor up.Belkin software was easy to use and configure. Maybe my HP Pavilion causes a lot of RF interference? Unknown, but I'd try a Linksys or Hawking over the Blekin. Don't be swayed by the price."
Anne Hathaway did a great job as Jane Austin and this movie stayed very true to her real life (what we know of it anyway).
"The hot plate part is not big enough to fit the Starbucks ""city"" mugs, so note that. But a smaller mug (a.k.a. regular sized or one that doesn't have a wide base) will fit fine. I agree with other reviewers who said that it keeps drinks warm when full and hotter when less full. I think the product description should specify the size mug that fits. i will keep it because it works well."
"I read this book as a teenager, and I wanted my students to read it as well. Although I loved it, I did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video. However they did think the video was cheesy... :D"
"While there is some very good information in the book, I ask you to consider the source. Ms. Quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her, that she was acting reasonably. The jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. Her approach is a bit aggressive."
"A lot of the battery backup alarm clocks only provide for backup of the settings. If the power is out when the alarm is suppose to go off, you're out of luck. This one is different. It has a backup ""mini-buzzer"" alarm that will go off at the set alarm time even if you have the alarm set to radio. I'm in a situation where I cannot afford to wake up late. It's comforting knowing I don't have to worry about the power being out and the alarm not sounding."
I am very unimpressed by this product. Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made. After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
"I purchased this product since I was looking to try something to cover my hyperpigmentation. I was already happy with a different product but I was trying to save a few dollars and at the same time give something else a try. I was not happy with the outcome. First of all, the product comes in a ""chapstick"" type of container and size so for my age spots, I have to use quite a lot of product. I used it before I applied my foundation and it just didn't give me the coverage my previous concealer did. I agree with the saying, ""cheaper isn't always better"" and will be going back to my previous concealer."
As bland as white bread. It is a misrepresentation to link this series of 3 CDs in any way to the Buddha Bar CDs or the chillout music category in general. It could play in the background without anyone ever raising their head or moving their body. If your thing is New Age music this might be for you. Everyone else is forewarned.
"A wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives... Read the book, too. Not for the shallow-minded."
"Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn't waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes, but wanted a refresher before the big event. While the information is consistent with what we've learned from other professionals - the presenter is terribly annoying. Although we wanted the information, the jokes were so unbearable we had to stop watching. If you can deal with the presenter's sense of humor, you'll benefit from the information - good luck!"
"I am a big fan of the Super Mario Brothers - the video game and the TV show. I had high hope for this movie, but boy what a waste of time this was. This movie sure give the Super Mario Brothers a bad name. If you haven't seen this movie, I envy you. Nothing like the game of the show. It NEVER should have been made; period."
"My husband bought this CD for me during a recent visit to the UK, and I don't like it. I'm a Buddy Holly fan, but sound quality is poor, and it doesn't compare to his later recordings in terms of arrangements and singing style. Not my cup of tea."
"A great gift for Marvel readers and a coffee table book for Marvel Families. This book brings back memories and provides helpful chronology. In the sixties, Iron Man was yellow, the X-Men were blue and yellow, and Daredevil was black and yellow. Marvel sure liked yellow."
"Mercifully, Arianna injects enough humor into this book to keep the reader out of the inevitable funk that would come from the revelations inside. Well done."
"My son's two favorite things in the world: 1. Little Einsteins, 2. Space. He went crazy when he saw the commercial for this new DVD. We, too, pre-ordered the movie and counted down the days until its release. And we, too, were bitterly disappointed by its contents. As the other reviewers have said, it is not a movie, and it is not about space. I would think that if Disney were going to release a space-themed DVD containing old episodes, they would at least include Galactic Goodnight. At least that one actually talked about the planets. I would not have purchased this if I would have been able to preview it before buying. :("
It worked at first but the connection kept dropping. Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears. You can't get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so can't change any settings. A total waste of time and money - don't bother with it.
The blue portion of the mats was a different blue. It looked more like a navy blue which I found very disappointing because that's like having a pair of bootleg mats.
"Had bought a set of the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick cookware, but it did not include a 2 qt. covered Saucepan.This size is something I use a lot. I love the lighter weight than the 14 yr. old set we had. The rubberized handle and lid are great.I love the glass lid and the nonstick finish is great! Clean-up is very easy. I don't use high heat as directed, but do boil in the saucepanwithout any damage being noted. I highly recommend this size pan and the whole set. It is less expensive than some of the more popularbrands, but I like the look and function better. I am a very satisfied customer."
"I liked the first movie. It was generally Hollywood fluff, but was interesting enough that I could suspend my disbelief to the point I found it enjoying. An acquaintance of mine recently raved about the sequel and between that and the reviews here I was very anxious to see it when my colleague mentioned she had just bought it. Imagine my surprise when I caught myself watching the clock, rolling my eyes and eventually contemplating shutting off the machine during several points in the film.Kirsten Dunst lost whatever acting ability she had shortly after Interview with a Vampire. She doesn't seem to have the range or depth to portray the complexities of the relationship between M.J. and Parker. Macguire, I guess, plays a sadsack to a tee - but I don't think I've ever seen him play anything else.The one redeeming part of the entire movie is the fight scenes, while completely unbelievable - the effects are flawless."
"LOTF is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter. Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism, but he does this in a manner that is easy to understand. His writing style is simple and clear and without all of the complex language that can bog down a good novel. This story flows at a nice pace and never seems to ""drag on"".I enjoyed this novel. Underneath the symbolism there was a fast-moving, suspenseful story. And Golding did a good job in making the reader of this novel contemplate the nature of man and society. It's well worth the read."
"Seeing as how Series 2 of ""Sherlock"" has yet to make it to the United States, I was hoping that this would be the script, or at least an adaptation of the script to a novel format. Sadly, this was not the case.I confess that I fail to see how this series (of BBC Books) distinguishes itself from the other (often free) editions, much less the compilations, available in the Kindle store. There is a new introduction by a member of the BBC's ""Sherlock"" staff and company, but that scarcely justifies the cost.The text itself is the standard text by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle which speaks for itself."
"This study guide not only lets me pass the exchange 5.5 exam, but she provides a very useful information about the exchange 5.5 in which I can't find from other MCSE books. I quite enjoy to study the chapter 12 ( Managing an exchange Environment) and chapter 16 (Migrating to exchange). Whatever you choose this book for exam or knowledge, that's a good choice."
"I recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband's birthday. Within a week, all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed 2 - 3 inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs. I paid $160 dollars for these pajamas, more than silk PJs listed from other suppliers on Amazon, expecting I was buying quality. After a week's use, they are heading for the rag bag and I feel defrauded."
I am not one for writing reviews. Just in it for the music. Dance With Angels is FANTASTIC! You pass on this CD and it is your loss.
"This is a fascinating subject, but Kuhns makes too many mistakes in areas I'm familiar with for me to trust there are none in areas I'm not. Her discussion of pagan culture is muddled; she collapses together customs of different centuries as if all pagans of all places and times were interchangeable. The book also shows signs of having been spell-checked by computer."
i didn't like this book very much. it seemed more like a children's book compared to lotr. Just an opinion
"I only read Dune after I had seen the movie (2 hour version) and was overwhelmed! I then proceded to read the rest of the series (6 books) and tape all three (the two, three and four-hour) versions of the movie. The book Dune is one you must read thru at least twice, including the glossary and index before all the ramifications of the 'history' start to become clear (The Butlerian Jihad, for example) and the realizations will change your first impressions, and so you will READ IT AGAIN!! I would love to read a 'prequal' of this series, but alas, for naught. For a great time on a rainy Saturday, get all six, sit down, and read them in order. You will not be disapointed."
"This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in 1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK, AN ABSOLUTE PAGE TURNER!"
"even in the hour plus ''build-up/charactor developement''.i guess talky,anti american ''horror'' movies is the latest trend.i was watching the talky trailer on my computer and got sleepy."
"Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid myself, with her as well as with my hubby. The Peanuts gang is classic and simple. Love them!"
"I own another Sony VCR (SLV N-71) which is nice. This one was for the kids, but it's going back. The VCR is noisy - very distracting. Picture is fair. I expect more from Sony products."
If you ride a bike you need one of these. The only complaint I have is with the bluetooth. It has two channels of bluthooth but has a very limited amount of phones that it will work with. Most of them are very old model. If you hook up a phone not on the list it will pair up but if you also pair up a headset then it goes crazy. Once I found an old phone (Motorla RAZR) it works great.
I typed in USB headset in the search box and because this one was the cheapest I purchased it. When it finally arrived I found out it was not a usb headset which was never written on the product description. The sound quality is good and the mic quality was horrible.
"Ugh...how much can one read about the landscape...the rocks...the rivers??? and Ayla & Jondalar having sex?? I skipped through most of the book and was still bored. What a disappointment, after waiting so many years!I do not recommend this book to anyone.I won't be reading any other sequals of the Earth's Children after this one!!"
"Here it is. I purchased this for my Dad, 79 years young. Finding anything for him, that he hasn't seen, heard or done is very difficult. Imagine my surprise when he sent me a note stating this was the BEST gift he'd received in a long time! I also bought him ""the Evolution of Useful Things""... same message! Both are super-duper gifts!"
"I can't beleive this printer only worked for 3 months. I bought it last Dec, but only start to use it 3 months ago. Now it stopped working. Does anybody know this printer has any warranty? Thanks!"
I am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title.I've been lost in the 'Alzheimer' labyrinth for the past decade.I have no need for a condescending book of this ilk.The title alone makes me want to vomit.Shame on the authors and anyone associated with it.Alzheimer's Disease is too complex a disease for a 'Dummies' manual.This deeply disturbs me.~m
"This book should be read by everyone and anyone who is able to appreciate good Victorian literature, George Eliot's THE MILL ON THE FLOSS is one of the greatest creations. Too bad she isn't getting all the hype flowery Austen and quite dull Forster is getting in Hollywood."
"I got the feeling when I was listening to this album that he wasn't there musically or lyrically. The majority of this album is just passé and I could take it or leave it. Forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player, and he couldn't even give you five minutes to really get into it. The other songs sound as if he was going off into left field. Now only if he could JustgivemeawholealbumIcouldlistentoo!"
"Be prudent. It is a dangerous concoction. The fumes can give a soar throat, swollen glands, and you might not get the smell out of your nose for a few days. It needs warning labels, and testing."
From the first day I bought this product it had problems.....I called my service provider and we established that my connection is fine.....its definitely the router!! I called Belkin tech support and they tried to sell me service support in order to fix my problem!!! I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED!! The thing keeps losing connection and i have to unplug and replug the darn thing to get it going again!! Its a pain! i wish i had spent a few dollars more and got a decent router!!
"I've had a horrible time with this F5D6020 PCMCIA card. I'm quite adept with wireless networks - have two laptops and several desktops with wireless cards in them. Some of the biggest problems I've had have been with this Belkin card, Windows Zero Configuration for wireless networks, and WEP secured networks. I connect to wireless networks, secured and unsecured, just fine, but the drivers are mangling ARP, and so I can't run TCPIP over the connection.Despite the fact that the card is advertised to work with XP, it doesn't include signed drivers - and the drivers it does have are what's wrong with it."
"Took a class to become a Class 1 Florida Home Rater. This book was given to every student in the class. It seems to have quality information that is put in a simple format to read.Before I took the National RESNET test(passed), I highlighted and tab the book which was very useful come test time. I also bought the Online version and up it to my web site so I could use adobe search at test time.I found the online book not to be as beneficial because I was faster using my tabs. So I would recommend the Soft book version over the Online Adobe version. I think you learn more by highlighting and tabbing an actual book too.If you plan to take the National RESNET Test then this book is a must to have."
I believe this book has the power to transform the way you view life. I am a teacher and I discuss this book in my class. It is always intriguing to the kids. I now raffle it off at the end of the year and I can't tell you how happy the students are to receive it. It opens their eyes to how important their thoughts and feelings are. That is a wonderful gift to give a child.
"This book was my first exposure to Alan Dean Foster. I though the beginning was somewhat slow, but it was character development. I really loved the pendju, but I was upset when I conc was introduced. As the story continued to progress, I decided that it was actually for the better, and turned out to be an excellent book. I just wish it was longer/had a sequel... =)"
"I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally, I hated the book."
"Easy installation. Tivo has a rating of reception, and I couldn't get it to go more than 50-58%. But it still works."
"truly a disappointment. and that's only because Catherine Wheel need to be held at a very high standard. they have produced some fine masterpieces in the past, culminating with the show (and heart) -stopping Adam and Eve. additionally, when you have the huge talents of Tim Friese-Greene at your disposal (he created a large part of two other masterpieces, Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock - get them), you best not surface with mediocrity. well, they have. there's no texture, no diversions, no heavily-lidded emotion, no cathartic, blissful moments of sound.new record label..... firing of their bassist (? )..... many bands have tried to shake things up mid-career, hate to see another talented one follow the same fate.i'm still a fan, but this album will surely go to the bottom of (the) Catherine Wheel bin for me."
"I gave it five stars because I liked it. I considered giving it four stars because I don't think this book will hold much for a person who hasn't read the previous books in the series. It ties up loose ends and sets up an interest for upcoming adventures, but it doesn't carry a lot of excitement of its own. Obstacles are too easily overcome. This book works well as a step in a larger series, but I don't think it could stand on its own."
"Heart of a Jaguar book had an O.K. plot, and there were some good parts. However, the gorey parts made the whole book unenjoyable for me. Since many of them are not appropriate to discuss on the internet, I will not give examples - but they were disgusting. Occasionally the characters did inappropriate things, or used profane language. I know this was how people acted in Mayan days, but the discription of some things was a little bit much. So if you love reading about bloody and gorey things, you would enjoy this book."
"This item arrived DOA after initial Charge. The replacement also did not start after initial charge. I was able to get it to start after removing the battery for 5 hours. Then it worked great until I powered down, then the same problem. I could not get the update software to find the device even though windows Xp found and gave it a drive designation. I thought upgrading the OS system would fix the power problem. Nokia support could not help, I was told to send the unit in for warranty repair. When it was working for the short time it was promising. Maybe just a bad batch, I think I'll order the N810 instead and cross my fingers."
I felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more. Still I thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become.I thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same. The mechanical hound was a great part of the story. It had us guessing if it would attack Montag or not. Over all I felt this book was well worth reading.
"I feel cheated in some way. I heard Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw on The Howard Stern Show playing ACOUSTIC versions of these songs. I liked the sound a lot. Then I bought the CD and found that none of the songs on the CD are acoustic at all.I'm a big Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw fan otherwise I wouldn't have purchased the CD at all, but these songs are really just cheap karaoke versions of great songs. Shaw-Blades bring nothing new to them. The sound is VERY watered down. Like Muzak in an elevator. My advice would be to just buy the original versions of these songs as performed by the original artists.I'll show mercy and give it two stars (which it doesn't deserve) because I did like California Dreamin' (although even with that one give me the original).Shame on you Shaw-Blades, are you really that hard up for money at this point in your career that you need to release a karaoke CD ?"
Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man. U should wait to get the progress pet or the double soul PET.
"I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft."
"Why on Earth would ""nothing is made from scratch"" be a selling point for a cookbook? How horrid!For good, simple cooking, look into Mark Bittman's cookbooks."
this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
The package contained just one stretched canvas and not 6 as the description claims. I had to return this order as Amazon cannot replace it for some reasons.
"I am a fan of traditional theorem-proof exposition, and this Ostebee-Zorn text demonstrates why. This book attempts to make calculus easy to understand, but the only result is that it is impossible to follow. Essential concepts are buried deep within piles of verbiage, and the examples skip important steps making them hard to follow. Add to that the large number of typos and errors in the solutions manual. As a teaching assistant, I have had strong mathematics students who could not understand this book and whose knowledge of calculus suffered as a result. With so many quality calculus textbooks on the market, it is hard to understand why a school would choose to use this unsuccessful experiment."
"This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I'm a woman, why not?) The lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in REALLY learning about childbirth. She explains everything. How your body should be functioning, what is stretching, what liquids to look for as signs of this and that, charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it's growing and she even quizzes the husbands! There is so much to learn. Open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though, it's like four or five hours long. PHEW. But it probably wouldn't be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway. It is a lot of information to grasp. Enjoy!!"
Eragon was looking for a deer to eat for his family. He tried to get the deer but he found an egg instead. He did not know what was inside of it. One day the egg hatched and a baby dragon came out. Then the dragon flew in the sky and turned into a big dragon. But then Eragon had to fight the darkness and kill the person who makes fire. Read this book to find out if the firemaster dies. This book is for eight-year-olds and up.
"I got this game for my birthday (I'm 35) and I love it! It's like a high-tech version of chess. Definitely makes you think hard and try to plot out your moves many steps in advance. It's especially tricky because you have to simultaneously think offensively and defensively. If you like classic strategic boardgames, you'll love this game."
I bought this book for my 8 yearold grandson and did not even give it to him. The book appears to be miniaturized. The print is so tiny that many people would not be able to read it without magnifying glasses! It is not appropriate for children given this tiny print. The pictures are well done and it would have been a perfect gift if the print were not so small.
Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
I like all the stargates. But this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd. Other then that it's another great stargate film.
"The scanner looks nice but very deceiving, I bought this scanner because of the name Xerox.I had it for about 2 months and scanned maybe 100 sheets, now it died!Xerox after 3weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say I will get a refurbished unit. (Bad company)"
"Let me tell you this movie was the funniest thing i havve ever seen buy it, hey it's not like its a great deal of money you'll enjoy everything about it from the cheerleaders to the funky psche outs. get it quick!!"
"The book was not so good as the movie, but the book helps understanding some points that seemed totally random when I saw it.Compared to 1984 it's miles away, but still is really nice."
"Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70's by using a sample of the classic ""clean up the ghetto"". Monday Midnite's freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus, the song keeps you dancing till the last beat. Love it."
I brought this tires for a friend in 26 x 1.75 she hasn't had a problem nor has she had a flat and she loves them....
"Techno, house, ambient, dance, electronica, whatever you want to call it, ""Everything is Wrong"" is just great music by a great artist. It has everything a fan of pop music could want."
"The title says it all! This is hands down the best face wash I've ever encountered. Light, mildly fragrant, and deep cleansing. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized."
"This product is good for UK only. To play in USA you need to find a DVD player which has capability for changing Region Code to UK and that you may be able to do it on computer but not on DVD player in USA. I order it in USA, prodact came from Uk and I couldn't play it on my most advanced DVD player."
"How can you not love the classic version of Disney's Pinocchio. The platinum edition has a bunch of extras and enhanced quality. It felt like I was 8years old again, and watching it in the movie theater. A must buy for any Disney animation fan."
"Esta novela es entretenida, pero definitivamente no es el mejor trabajo de Isabel Allende. El final no deja mucho que decir. Mi recomendación es que lean otras novelas de Isabel Allende, como ""La Casa de los Espiritus"", que es mucho mejor que ésta."
I thought the book was very good. It does get a little boring to me because of so much explicit detail written in on everything. The book is around 750 pages but well worth the read. Can't wait for the final book.
"This book is fabulous. I am a 25 year old female who has always been ""the nice girl."" It's not as if I haven't had relationships. Yet, even in those relationships, I always felt like a ""doormat."" My friends and I always wondered why the guys we didn't like kept coming around. We would sit in the car and read this book aloud to each other. This book is liberating, and I recommend it to any woman looking to take control of herself and her love life."
The photo and description do not reflect the product. The screen panel kit I received was white. What a huge inconvenience during a time-crunch.
I've bought two copies of this movie on DVD and each one was missing the ghost viewers. Buyer beware if you buy this DVD....you may get what you pay for or you may not.
"Ok people. I like POP music, I do. I like good produced pop music even if artist is commercial. This CD is no different than Pink or Britney CD's as Mr. Clay is claiming to be, different that is. He said people are tired of fake pop stars. Well to tell you the truth, he is no different. It is marketing machine that is trying to tell people how he is so like you, ordinary and all nice, so you could buy his CD. Well that don't matter too much to me if the music is good, but this CD ain't nothing special. Ordinary power ballads with cheap lyrics. I also have message for Clay: Kid, good job with stories about how you're so different than Justin and Pink. American public eats them for lunch, and please now that you have money get someone else to write you album because this one sucks!!!"
Mest is the Best!!!! I just got there cd and i fell in love with it the first time i listened to it. This is a cd every music fan must get. the songs r kick [behind] and so r the guys. if u don't go out and buy this cd i'm going to MEST you up!!!!
"Being a huge Spenser fan I am of course a Robert B. Parker fan. Sunny Randall makes her debut in this yarn of sex, deceit and extortion. Not his best but getting his feet wet with this new female perspective, he makes more than a solid effort. (he gets the ball rolling in following tales) I'm grateful to Mr. Parker and his pen (figuratively???) If you are a fan...don't miss it. If you're not...WHY not???!!!!"
"Yes this has good graphics, Yes it has a kind of Zelda theme. But really if your looking for a game that fits the Lord of the rings best then get the Two Towers. Once you are used to that then get the The Return of the King. That is the best game of them all. Ive played all three and the Fellowship is by far the worst game i have ! Please Gameboy dont let Vivendi Universal (the makers of this game) ever make a game based on a film ever again. They wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you. DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!!"
"Author Greg Kelly was 10 years old growing up in Rockford, Ill., when Ray Lee Stewart went on a weeklong killing spree that took 6 lives and shook the community's small-town midwestern roots. Like so many others in Rockford, Greg was terrified until long after Stewart's capture and haunted by his crimes for years afterwards. Fifteen years later as a young newsman working at WGN Television in Chicago, Greg called in sick so he could attend the murderer's clemency hearing. A few weeks later he witnessed the execution. Kelly's vivid description of that eerie evening is alone worth the price of the book, as are the insights into courtroom proceedings, TV reporting, and Kelly's portraits of victims' families and their suffering."
"I played a couple of adventure games (Syberia and another one I don't recall) and I got really enthralled by this game genre, so, based on everyone's review, I got this one.Technical issues aside, I just couldn't get drawn into it. The story is too new-agey, too ""evil white males vs pure frolicking happy people"", etc etc. I just couldn't get to care for the main character, for the plot (I found myself rooting for the bad guys), and would get annoyed at the choices I was given.After enduring the first chapter, I had enough and uninstalled it.The graphics (dated, but good) and execution (didn't encounter a single bug) save this one from a 1 star rating."
"I don't care for the author's abuse of the time line. Duras' character development is firm, but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing. Duras' message of using the women's body as a form of control and yet making the main character seem separated from her body doesn't seem to really say anything."
"I'm a little tired of hearing 'this is just the same as -blah blah- song/album and it's horrible/boring'. I love Ebadue and Africa i and ii, so I'm elated that 'the River Sings' has a similar feel. I think it's an amazing song and my favorite on the album. 'Amarantine' and 'Somebody Said Good-bye' remind me of the vocal songs from 'A Day Without Rain'. I never much cared for the songs with words before Wild Child, Lazy Days, etc, which are among my favorites from all of her works. 'Less than a Pearl' is hauntingly beautiful, and 'Semiregusa' is also very pretty.I've always enjoyed listening to any of Enya's albums to relax from a long day at work, for yoga and meditation; this album will definitely go into that mix. The above-mentioned songs will also go on my own 'Best of..' CD."
"I am a fan of Mr Patterson's books, but this one was very disapointing. It was like he sat down and wrote up a list of ""what will make women cry"" and then put every single thing in the book. It is overdone to the point of you can not connect to the characters because the tragedy's that happen to them are too much and in a manner that is not realistic to everyday life. Mr Patterson needed to think instead of what will make a woman cry but what will make a good story not a formulated story. This book tried to force the reader to be emotional and instead makes you feel annoyed at the characters and the story."
"Izzy does a great job of making the format of the book simple yet engaging. His explaination of the games with goals, group size, time, process and variations for each of the games is very helpful. It is written so that a sales team leader could pick it up and have some great games to get his/her team thinking creatively, working on teamwork and self confidence. My only complaint as a past performer and current instructor is that it isn't long enough. Write another."
"Wonderful poetry, interesting, slightly sad, personal, diverse, including some fragments (choral) in RussianInstrumental arrangments innovative, fusing pop sounds with Eastern colors and instruments (Ud?, Balalaika, Dombra?)The voice on the CD is intimate, powerful, very personal, sounds distinguish this CD from many pop recordings; some jazz elementsFavorite songs: Kabala, Sleep My Son, Queen of Night"
"This book, set in Paris in late December follows a hobo named Armand, who's gruff on the outside, but reveals his inner warmth when he finds a newly homeless family living under ""his"" bridge. While this book does have many good points, this isn't a book I would recommend. The story would be very entertaining to a fifth grader but the vocabulary skills and difficulty understanding Paris or gypsies would frustrate a reader in this age group. A sixth grader, however, would more easily comprehend the vocabulary (I admit that I didn't know many of the words and had to guess at their meaning in context--and I don't consider my vocabulary skills poor by any means) and cultural situations but they would be bored by the simplistic story. In all, I would not recommend it not because it is a bad book, but because I think there are better choices out there."
"If you follow my reviews, you know that I am Anglo Catholic and that the 2 versions I use most are the ""Good News"" and the ORIGINAL ""Revised Standard."" I have respect for the ""King James,"" the ""New King James,"" the ""Jerusalem,"" the ""English Standard Version,"" and the ""Holman Christian Standard."" I do NOT like the NIV or the NRSV. Onto the subject at hand. The NASB is widely praised as the most literally accurate version. It does not contain the Apocrypha. But being that this is a Protestant Bible, we can't really hold that against it. The NASB is widely accepted in Protestant churches. For the most part, it is carefully literal. I consider it an interesting cross between the ""Revised Standard"" and the ""New King James."" My one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the ""Revised Standard."" But that said, the ""New American Standard"" is excellent."
"Hugely disappointing. This book promises more than it really delivers. Having lived and worked as an architect in Africa, I found theresearch superficial and use of outdated references gives african architecture a less than positve image.I dont recoomend this book at all."
I have several ragged copies of this here and there in and out of boxes. I don't have to hunt any more. It'll always be on my Kindle.
"The first and second Robocop films were great. I loved the over-the-top action and humor elements in both films.Robocop 3 is a pure, unadulterated disaster. First off, it is way too tame (a PG-13 rating??!!). Second, the ""plot"" is completely ruined by the introduction of the ""cute little kid who is a computer whiz"" character, what a travesty! Third, the movie is actually boring; a boring Robocop movie! I could go on and on, but why bother.They dare to put this garbage on DVD?"
"This is the second edition of this book. The Translator spent years on researching and putting Schiller's works together. He worked closely with the Germans to make sure that he got this right. However, the second edition has the Translator's very own poem; The Translators Apology To The Reader as he had to make some corrections in his own translating. Schiller was a controversy of sorts in his time. Many of his poetry has to do with his one love Laura, the lady who first captured his heart, and had great impact on his life."
"I seriously don't think this cd deserves the avg rating it has got. This has got to be the ""worst"" in search of sunrise series by the `so called #1 dj' Tiesto...The very first song when crossfading with the second is patchy ...which means he cant get the basics right of beat matching. He could have at least perfected it in the studio before the release. (Im sure everyone who bought the cd agrees). Also there is no proper direction in the music. The tunes are not catchy...they are really boring...and sounds like someone is learning to play the keyboard (except Coca & Villa - La Noche), even the vocal tunes here are horrible.Tiesto has lost my vote for the top dj poll (paul van dyk was always #1 for me and will always be)I regret buying this CD. And am depressed with the current state of trance music. Only Paul Van Dyk can cure me with his Politics of Dancing 2 CD."
"Now this is what High Definition is all about.I was very Pleased with the ""Picture Quality"" on the ""Tremors"" HD DVD.The image makes you think you are watching a 2007 movie release.The picture is awesome."
"With today's current crop of movies, it is easy to think that quality films that make you think might have gone the way of the dodo. However, The Insider is a BIG exception to the rule. Don't let the long running time or the fact that it may seem like any other A & E documentary discourage you. This movie is potboiler that keeps you glued to the screen and howling at every the injustice of it all.One of the greatest compliments for this movie would have to be the fact that I watched it with five of my friends who could care less about current events or journalistic integrity, yet all of them sat through every single minute of it absolutely riveted to the screen.It is kind of discouraging seeing the self-censorship and the ""chilling effect"" on the media that's taken place since the events of the film. However, the film ends on a high note and is well worth watching if you enjoy great cinema!"
"This is a beautifully presented box set of Powell & Loy which gives youan insight to films they made together other than the ""Thin Man"" seriesthe clarity of the discs and the sound quality surprised me consideringthe films age.As for the actors I would buy a film of Powell and Loy shopping inWal-Mart i'm that easily pleased, but if you want to see the golden ageof Hollywood and a mixture of drama and screwball comedy at its bestthen look no further"
"with the great beat good lyrics and skilled players they are simply the best, the worst complaint ive heard is that you got to know a little about the 30's to get the lyrics, mista-s"
THE STONES WERE A GREAT BAND AND ALMOST AS GOOS AS THE BEATLES.ALL THEIR ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS ONE ARE CLASSICS.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS AND BUY THIS ONE.
"The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man, David Carson arriving at The Legacy House. Who he is and where he came from is discovered as the story moves on in the book. I am a fan of the series and the books except for this one. It was slow going and for one to understand what is happenning in the story you have to read very carefully or read it a second time. I did enjoy reading the other books in the series but ""The Shadows Between"" left me confused about what was going on. Sorry."
"We had two beloved cats die during my child's fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn't promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime, which I found slightly surprising."
"I bought this for my youngest son's third birthday. It is a great product! Both of my boys, (ages 3 and 6) love to play with it. It is a good outside or inside toy but to use it outside there can not be much wind because it is very light and will blow around easily. To use inside you do need lots of room. It can be put together or taken apart in less than 5 minutes so it is a toy you can buy even if you don't have room to always leave it up. I would recommend this toy to anyone. It would be a great toy for a baby just learning to craw."
"i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed, but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this. just too many variables. I can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage; at least 40' going thru two buildings. now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know."
"These headphones delivered exactly what I expected from a $41 set, good sound but lacking in the noise-cancellation department. The fabric cord with an extension piece is nice and the design makes it fun to wear. The switch for noise cancelling on/off is well located as it doesn't take up room on a seperate piece or on the cord and the foldable design makes the headphones relatively easy to transport with big pockets. Basicly, everything one can expect from Sony for $41. (Since flying with them I would change this to a 3 review... they just didn't deliver much with the noise cancelling."
Excellent book with profiles of folks who survived WWII and came back to our country to make a productive life for themselves. The format is very readable and the stories enjoyable despite some very serious pictures presented of the war.
"To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics, you'll like the book, conversely if you don't, you won't."
"this movie is simply the best i have ever seen. i am very into film, but this is simply great because of its wonderful story line, a great art direction, and wonderful camera work...all out A++++movie...everyone should have it!"
"Repetitive, slow, and too detailed.How could there have been a 12 year wait for a book that was for at least the first 700 pages a repetition of the first books? How many times do we need to be told Alya has to go to the bathroom more often now that she is pregnant? Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over? Where is the plot, the suspense, the action?I do not recommend buying this book, get on the waiting list at the library."
"This is a treasure trove of wonderful cookie recipes. Pecan crispies are light and elegant. Thumbprint, Russian teacake, meringues and sugar cookies are holiday favorites. Shamrock cookies become witches' fingers for Halloween with just omission of food coloring and a different rolling technique. Almond butter, French lace, nut crunch cookies. Of course, there are hundreds more--your favorites, no doubt! I recommend buying this book if you bake, or if you hope to. But I will add, it's not the ""original"" Betty Crocker cookie book. My mother has that--from the 30's or 40's I think, smaller and with fewer recipes, but awesome. This version has vivid color photographs so you can drool--or occupy your kids with just visuals--while you consider what to make next!"
"Grandma and a brother? That's just weird. I'm a Grandfather of a Five year old Granddaughter and I, I!, bought my Granddaughter the dollhouse and the full set of house furniture. What the, no, wtf were they thinking? Simpletons rule the fricking world. Grandma? Grandpa. Brother? Sister. Idiots.That said my Granddaughter loves this entire set. Full on wonderful for her, and yes if they came out with Grandpa with a sister I would buy both sets, throw the older brother away and give her the rest so maybe their not idiots, just soulless vampires."
All I can say is that i couldnt get through it. Poorly written and rather boring. I love a good fantasy book and there are many good ones out there that others have listed. Don't bother with this one
utter garbage - give me $1.00 for every flat note lauren hill hits on this album and I would be a millionaire
"The original version of this movie was great. Huston is superb as Calamity Jane, and Melanie Griffith is a great madame.But this version has been hacked to death by some uncaring editor. It has lost it's continuity and is very dissappointing."
"Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice."
This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
"I wasn't sure how I would react to this CD. It's not the usual style of music I listen to, but I love Clay Aiken's voice. I was pleasantly surprised. This CD rocks! My favorite song is Shine. I can't get it out of my head. I also love Measure of A Man and I Survived You. Yay Clay!"
"It says illustrated, in my table of contents, but it is not. I only purchased this to have the illustrated version."
smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel. but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics. use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point. all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville. It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.
"Way too many names, Way too much detail.There is a story hidden in this book, but it is hard to dig it out. It could have been a good read."
"The early years of Tangerine Dream produced some incredible music. Although Mirage lacks some of the drama of Schulze in the Tangerine Dream days, it is a very competent effort that makes for pleasant listening.After listening to this album, you can start to identify Schulze's contribution to Tangerine Dream, and also the musical personality of Klaus Schulze himself."
"We had the old DOS version of Hoyle Solitaire (1988 Copyright) and when I bought a new computer we wanted to update to a current version. Installed new version and found the following: 1.) Autoplay disappeared. Lets one play out finished game without manually clicking each card. 2.) Replay game is missing. Sometimes it took several tries to win a game, but this is gone now; you can't try again. I re-installed the old version from 1988 (One 1.4MB diskette) and find it better than the current version. Any owner of the old DOS version who buys this version will be severely disappointed; you spent money to downgrade to an inferior product."
"While I appreciate the daunting task of putting all that history into one volume, you'll find this book to be like the old adage more ""His story"" than history. The writer's personal value system shines through the book as he interprets his view of history. One interesting rant about his major premonition about the Roman Empire and how it was defeated by a child in Bethlehem. Other than a giving us a few vague moral lessons, Van Loon gave us no insight of what Jesus Christ did that was so revolutionary to topple the largest superpower ever. Could you give us a bit of depth? I don't get it."
"Horror writer Bentley Little moonlights in the suspense genre under the pseudonym ""Phillip Emmons."" Gruesomely original with the most politically incorrect serial killer ever committed to paper. The final setpiece in a Phoenix hospital, is a nail-biter."
"What can I say, the chapter on setting up your jointer is worth the price of the book by itself. The pictures and the diagrams are great, easy to understand, and the text is informative and easy to read. This book makes you a better woodworker, because your tools will be correctly set up, which also makes them more fun to use and much safer.I would recommend this book to you, even if you do not own the tool, but are looking at getting into woodworking, with this book you will be better able to understand how the various tools work, and you can buy decent used tools and tune them up, saving you a bundle!Great book!!"
As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash
A wonderfully written book that gives insight into a siginificant time in history with a very personnel look.
"This CD is magical, the lyrics are deep. I've been a Lauryn Hill fan from the way back days of the Fugees and she's simply AWESOME. It's no surprise she nabbed 5 Grammys from this album, her first solo. This represents what good music should be, just buy it and listen to it's magic!!! To say the truth, this album deserves 10 stars!!! Lauryn, I thank God for your life and inspiration, keep up the good work!!!"
"I picked this book up with an expectation of a fun memoir read. The premise was unique...cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's Art of French Cooking. I expected a fun romp of cooking mishaps, triumphant cuisines, interesting tales of kitchen disasters and enjoyments but instead it was nothing but a misguided attempt at a so-called memoir. Very, very disappointing."
The product was in a very old box and the AC/DC connection was just a bare wire. So I did return this item.
I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie. I usually like parodys but this movie was boring and unfunny.
"The book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general. Of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those. It's up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions. I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it, instead of stories of angry, sad boys."
"BABE is a wonderful movie, but this DVD does not allow the viewer to skip thru the previews. Once the movie begins you can skip around, but you have to sit thru a bunch of previews EVERY TIME your kid watches this movie."
"The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer truely is a mug warmer. I use it daily. My mug is warm, but my beverage isn't."
"DVD was in excellent condition, brand new. The Film is very good, well made, very good visuals to go with the story telling, however, this is a short version of the original film, that is the only negative of this production."
"Vanessa Carlton's release of her second album shows how talented she really is. Her touch of piano to the tracks make the album what it is: original and breath taking.""White House"", ""Who's To Say"", ""Afterglow"", ""Private Radio"", ""Half A Week Before The Winter"", and ""She Floats"" stand out from the rest of the album. Each one reveals Vanessa's look on life from the past, present, and future. They also show how she see the world and what she wishes it could be.The rest of Harmonium contain tracks that are amazing as well, for they tell stories which are ear catching. This album is not what I expected it to be after hearing her debut one; Harmonium is a work of art."
"WOW! I was hoping this game wouldn't be as bad as people said. It really sucks! No fun at all. Pretty to look at on my 1080p-but that's it. Fun-factor = 3/10 Glad I only paid 37.00 for it. In a nutshell, if you're under 15 yrs old, you will love this game! If not, spit on it. What a waste."
"I have seen this movie before, and was looking to buy it to show in my classroom, but...why the heck is it $99? It's good, but not THAT good!"
"Firstly, I found this cream to have an odd smell to it. Secondly, it moisturizes well but not as well as I had anticipated and hoped.This product was disappointing and I do not plan on repurchasing. There are other products from NeoStrata that I love but this definitely is not one of them!"
"When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop, I wasn't sure what to do. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4"
"When i first heard his single ""One Wish"" i thought this is a good tune, but then he got to the second verse, i thought eh? This guy cant sing! later on his album came along, his vocals destroy his tracks, literally. Comparing him to other artists such as Mario or 112, you'll realize that he can't sing, full stop. Disappointing."
"Christan Bale as a young Bruce Wayne/Batman is a much needed reinvention of the Batman movie franchise. He has amazing screen presence and makes you believe that he is the Dark Knight. I was impressed how naturally he jumped into the role and made it his own.The story is tight and easy to follow. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the parts filmed in Iceland. Big sweeping shots of snow covered mountains and raggedy buildings lining the slopes. Just fabulous.The 2 disc DVD set is spectacular. The video transfer is almost perfect and there are plenty of extras for the rabid Batman fan. The compilation comic book is a very nice addition. I would recommend this set to anybody."
"this book has a good title, it sounded great when I got it. The only thing is most of the plot is about how they got sucked into another world. It starts ok but then cars are trying to kill them, do cars randomly runing around trying to kill people sound like an important plot? I cant beleave she made a sequel."
"French Connection is a exciting action/crime film starring Gene Hackman as Popeye Dole, a N.Y. Narcotics Cop who is investigating the recent flow of herion coming into N.Y. He and his partner (Roy Shrieder) get into the absorbing process of phone tapping, following suspects, and stakeouts. A real good crime movie from director William Friedkin. One of the best films ever made, also has the most exciting chase scene in history. A winner!!"
"Paul Hoover is an experienced and successful poet having published six earlier books of award winning poetry. Totem And Shadow: New and Selected Poems continues to document his impressive talent wedded to an innate knack for memorable imagery. After Miss Graven's Remarks: Boy, my left eye cries when I see kids/play violins and things. How did they get/so young? And I can't stop my fractures/when they strike toy xylophones in a song/too sentimental, mechanical sugarplum fairies./It's brutal of them t kill me with growing up/like this, and Mrs. Pollen, who tends them,/why is she so kind under her matronly woolens?/What is so appealing in a clumsy, fuzzy/third-grader, ghostly in polyester as any/sad adult? Sure, there's no god to do it,/but they should have bright violent minds/to brace them for a while, and one tough look/keep them when Christmas isn't the mood."
Picture is fuzzy not digitallly remastered. Also Disk 2 had a glitch in it on the first play. Disk is clean. Over all quality is not great.
"This book was hard to put down. The story was excellent, and the erotic scenes were just as good. Like all of Anne's books, this one was very tastefully done. Well worth it!"
"Read the first couple of pages and then skip the next 250. It is all review. Auel should assume that people who are reading this book have read the others and should not spend 250 pages re-hashing what we already know. We already know people will be ""amazed"" and ""disbelieving"" of Ayla's and Jondalar's previous adventures. We do not need to sit with them while they tell the story to each of Jondalar's relatives.We also already know Ayla and Jondalar ""share pleasures"" more and better than any earthly couple ever did or could. I am not reading this story to get a ""thrill"". In the last book, it got to the point that whenever Auel wrote about pleasures, I just skipped it, because it disturbed the flow of the story. This book was no exception.I want more depth, more story and less review. I haven't given up on the series yet, but if I have to wait another 10 years for the next - I won't be buying it."
"I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot."
needs to be better packaged. it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through.
"This work is from the memoirs of an enlightened soul . written some 600 years ago, still applies to every day life in the 21st century. Better than any ""self help"" book on the market. It's a self help guide, to peace - integrity - and enlightenment of our soul . Seen through eyes of a free spirit, indentured to service. living by a code"
"When I received this cap I thought I was getting a letter. The cap was crammed into a flat envelope. Terrible quality,very flimsy brim. Awful item. I don't know where the positive reviews came from. This is a cap I will NEVER wear. In fact it went from the envelope it came from straight into the trash where it belongs. Very bad buying experience would not ever buy from this seller again. This is NOT a military cap. It's a crap cap made in China."
"First of all, why make a film that is an ""imaginary portrait"" of Diane Arbus? It consists of a made-up story about Arbus and a neighbor with a medical condition that makes him hairy all over. Kidman, of course, is wonderful, Robert Downey, Jr. is very disappointing, and ultimately the viewer is disappointed too. I suppose Arbus' real life story wasn't interesting enough."
This book contains a myriad of case studies concerning a wide variety of acoustical problems. Very rich in detail. I found it helpful when trying to tackle challenging acoustical problems.
"I always thought this was a lame movie, but I really love it now that I've seen it. Yes, it IS a chick-flick, so if you don't like those types of movies, don't buy it."
This is a book for every teen to read. It gives the feelng of pride... and intense excitment!
"Beautiful and irresistible brass band from Italy, fans of Tom Waits would love it, has a very similar feel to some of his work - nicely orchestrated, moody dirges.Track one features guest vocals by Dani ""El Mono Loco"" Carbonell, of Macaco and Ojos de Brujo. Other vocalists appear and they are great too. Mostly an instrumental album though."
"What a wonderful, easy book to read. And so helpful. So many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read. Not the Gluten-Free Bible. It is clear, easy-to-understand and very engaging. I really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living gluten-free to everyday life. It is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very, very informative at the same time. I have never written a book review before, but I am so impressed with The Gluten-Free Bible that I want to share these thoughts with everyone and I intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful, witty writer. Enjoy! To your health!"
"Every chapter was a revelation about the demographics of North and South America before Columbus. Most american indian populations were agricultural with substantial population centers with running water and covered sewers, unlike the European cities of that same time period.The scale of the devastation caused by the introduction of European diseases, particularly smallpox, is so immense as to be incomprehensible. The rate of fatality in the European black death episodes was 1 in 3, while that for the smallpox plagues in the americas was 19 in 20."
My father got me hooked on these books. They are extremely well written and just fun to read. Anyone who just wants a good mystery without all the sex and swearing will love these books.
"This work has much interesting information but I do not think it truly defines the 'Jewish Mind'. I have the sense that the Jewish Mind if we consider its creations from Biblical Time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition. I would too say that as Jews value the idea of Creation , their own Mind is in a constant process of Development and creation. Any summary then seems to be a simple reduction, and not true to the Reality."
This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen. What a waste of talent & money. One has to wonder what someone was thinking when this was made. I could only stand to watch half of it.. Don't waste your time & money.
There is an extended version and this is not it. It is on television all the time. Clever of the WB to make the first two extended and not the next two. I assumed they were extended and bought them.
"its full of action, adventure and some romance and though i dont like spiders, the spider man is kick ass<3"
"This cd was alot different than waiter. The first track is the next eight put together. Long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs, much more digital than the pervious album. his vice is possibly better in this cd, definatly worth the ep price"
"Probably my 2nd favorite disposable I find them to be very reliable and they smell nice. However the scent does concern me and while all disposables contain chemicals I wonder about the more so when I'm using scented Pampers. Regardless, combined with Subscribe and Save this is a total win-win the price and service can't be beat. I'm a ""part-time"" cloth diaper user and subscribe and save has made filling in the gaps very easy I can't say enough how much I love it."
"I just began using this book to review for the GRE in April. I haven't gotten very far into the book, but in the first 15 pages I have already found four seriously misleading errors (and that's just the ones I've caught!). Some of the equations (even the Henderson-Hasselbalch) they provide are wrong. There is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation. You can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the GRE, but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks."
"This looked great at first... but then I started looking at the calorie counts for most of the dishes. Most of the Main Dishes have less than 200 calories, some have less than 100. I don't have time to cook and eat 8-10 meals per day."
"I have never seen this movie, and a friend kept talking about it.....what a great story! And the cast is superb!"
"The story is totally different than the book. All they took was the name and a couple of the characters.The story was pretty much a rip-off of the Terminator. Just think about it.(...) What is this thing next to the what, who did this and why?"
"It's amazing how weak this album is. The drum programming is tedious and sounds banal as do the riffs and the production. THis is a truly terrible album probably the worst most uninspiring thing I've ever had the mispleasure of hearing. I was so put off by this album I never gave them a second chance so I don't know if their other albums are any good, I do know that Rosetta Stone's Adrenaline and the Sisters of Mercy's - First and Last and Always are infinitely better examples of this programmed drum gothic rock type schtick."
This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.
"This was a really good investment. I use it during some of my aerobic exercise dvds and I walk/jog/run with it on. The only negative is that you can't wear it on the outside of your clothing, because it looks like a bulletproof vest and then there are a lot of eyes staring at you. So, I decided to wear it under my clothing, it is a little bulky but it isn't so bad. I highly recommend it for someone who is new to to the vest. It is economical and it will serve the purpose of helping toGoFit 10-Pound Walking Vest with Removable Water Bottle Holdershed those pounds."
I love this stuff! I first bought in Hawaii and it made my skin feel and smell so wonderful. So I bought it online to bring me back to those great hawaii memories when I cant be there in person!
"I have no problems with the movie. But technically, the quality of this disc is beyond terrible. It looks like a YouTube video does when you play it on a 50-inch plasma. Only worse -- compression artifacts, tiling with squares the size of Post-it Notes, banding that looks like 16-bit grayscale. It made the whole thing unwatchable for me. [...]"
For Years i been taking it yes your urine may turn yellow i have orange label and sometimes if you eat it with food your stomach might hurt but its life its a good vitamins A C E D The best! I Rec People To Try This Vitamin
"I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work."
Ordered for delivery for Christmas but after order was told it would not be delivered by Christmas. It was confirmed at purchase time to be delivered before Christmas. Now I have to go back out and find it in a store and then try and return this one to Amazon. Not much fun...
"Eragon is an awesome read for people of all ages, ecspecially those who enjoy fantasy. Eragon has managed to hold my attention better than many fantasy books including the Lord of the Rings series. It's a fantastic story about a boy that enters the ranks of the legendary ""Dragon Riders"". I don't want to give too much away so honestly if you have a chance read Eragon it's incredible. Just one warning start early in the evening, if you don't you'll find it's well past midnight before you manage to find a good place to leave off."
"I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all, but she had no trouble with setting this up. She's completely happy, California is happy, and I'm happy."
"This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn't that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally ""twisted"".I can't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don't buy one."
I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.
The product is as described but the only thing that would fit was the side pieces. There was no place to mount the bracket to the radio. Rather than start over just taped it to radio and mounted the screws. Seems to be holding soo far.
I accidently bought two copies of this DVD. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars had to be gaming the system.
"Wishywashy cause-proclamation from a once brilliant tunesmith and vocalist. It's okay to buy into feminism, tree-hugging and wicca in one's personal life, but to create an album on a major label about this stuff, to slow and barely tuneful music is a major mistake. If you're unfamiliar with Laura Nyro, this is not the place to begin. Try ""Eli and the Thirteenth Confession,"" ""The First Songs"" or pretty much anything else. Leave this one for Gloria Steinem or the next PETA convention."
"I am really dissappointed with Amazon. This product was meant to be delivered to me on the 19 March 2008. To date it has not been delivered, i have paid for it . I have tried to contact Amazon customer services to no avail. I will never purchase anything from the amazon website again."
"If Sinatra was considered the Chairman of the Board, Tony Babino will be considered President and CEO of the company. From the opening chord of this CD, you'll be very, very impressed with Tony B's powerhouse vocals. He belts out the standard, ""I've Got The World On A String"" with a livelier arrangement, to a heartfelt rendition of ""And I Love Her"". If you think he might be another cover artist, you'll be wrong. Tony B writes his own songs as well. He wrote 4 of the 14 tracks on this CD. Some of his own compositions like ""50 Years"" and ""Sentimental Heartstrings"" are better than some standards. This is a superb CD. You'll definitely, without a doubt, enjoy this CD. As the title suggests...you'll be ""Swingin' Around with Tony B."" for a long time to come."
"this product is ok however, unlike the discription claims it is not easy to cut, even with new sharp tools, the seets that I recieved tend to be very hard almost like Lenoleum tile for your floor, but even harder serface then even those. Either the product some where got exposed to extreame heat or its old."
I thoroughly enjoy this album. It has been a while since I purchased a CD of Nanci. I was not disappointed. The selections were excellent.
"It was a great choice between BD and DVD, of course I bought the BD. As you all know the quality is far more better than regular DVD. The movie had a pretty good opening to and it was very catchy. Story has a pretty good plot to it but it wasn't as good as the first movie. there were more action on the first movie compared to this. All in all it was a great and fun movie to watch."
"If you're looking for something to hold you over until the next book in the Harry Potter series, don't look here. As a writer of fantasy, Diane Duane makes an excellent science fiction author. If you consider sentient marble-sized galaxies, ferocious living helicopters and predatory automobiles the staple for a book about magic and wizardry, then by all means get yourself a copy. Otherwise, check out some of the more traditional fare, like The Magician's Nephew (or the other books in The Chronicles of Narnia series) by C.S. Lewis, or two shining stars by Madeleine L'Engle: A Wrinkle in Time, and Many Waters."
I bought this so my son could have a pocket to stash his car stuff in. So far so good. The price was good.
"Being a person who enjoys the sound of trance but not necessarily a fan of it, I thought I knew what this album was going to sound like but it was not even that of which I thought. Expecting a fast paced and heavy techno sound such as from Paul Oakenfold's Tranceport, the album was very different. Sasha experiments with all sorts of sounds and many different tempos and emulates the sounds of heavy trance as well as slower paced techno beats like you would hear from the Crystal Method or Paul Oakefold's Ibiza. This album dips through the sounds of trance, pop, big beat, and even a slow trip-hop beat in Mr. Tiddles. Airdrawndagger is one of the most diverse albums that I have heard is the trance/dance genre, and no trance or dance fan should be without it. I give it 4 stars."
"I was given this as a christmas gift, and it's more than lived up to my expectations.It won't heat a cold cup of coffee, but it will keep a cup at a very nice temperature for a very long time.Works best if you actually drink the coffee, the less coffee in the cup, the more effective it is... A full cup of coffee left for a couple hours will moderately warm, but if you actually drink the coffee slowly over time, the end will still be a good temp."
"This book stunk. I believe that reality can have deeper meanings, but don't get to deep or you'll drown. The only time you can go that deep and not drown, is with drugs. I never thought Lord of the Flies would attract so many druggies."
This made in China not the USA as advertised. Im sending this back to the false advertisers! Do not buy this unless you are ok with supporting china.
"Binaural is a mix of the new sound of Pearl Jam with the drummer Matt Cameron. It's great to hear Eddie playing different instruments like the ukele. Somehow pj sounds traditional in this age of boy groups and pop music. In 1998 they released the album Yield. Songs like In Hiding, and Given To Fly were ballads that showed off the mild rocking side of pj. Now on Binaural, you have songs like Breakerfall and Light Years that have simmilar rocking styles. Nothing as it seems, gives off the a Pink Floyd sounding background guitar by Mcready. Overall after listening to the new album twice it has grown on me!"
"""The Proposal"" is an intelligent, first-rate undercover police story with a lot of twists and turns that you can never see coming. The Director has a real knack for building tension and suspense... it keeps increasing as the story progresses, and the mystery deepens as it unfolds. Jennifer Esposito really proves that she can play the leading role in a feature... she's radiant, and Nick Moran (from ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"") plays the nervous, paranoid undercover cop to perfection. Stephen Lang (Tombstone) is awesome as the subtly psychotic Crime lord, and it's nice to see William B. Davis (X-files' Smoking Man) play an FBI agent who DOESN'T smoke! Very clever, unpredictable, good looking film noir. Highly recommended."
"There's no doubt that Green Mountain's Dark Magic K-cups make extremely good cups of coffee. It's just that I don't think it packs that much of a punch. The finest espresso K-cup I've tried so far is GM's Espresso Blend. I like my extra dark coffee to have a little bitterness to it. That quality makes me know that it's strong, and Espresso Blend has it. Dark Magic is lacking that ""something extra."" I think the word ""sweet"" in the product description is the culprit here. Either way, I'd still recommend these to anybody, but Espresso Blend is the best espresso-like coffee to date.(Note: I have 3 varieties that I've never tried coming in the mail: Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, and Revv. It's highly possible that one of those could unseat Espresso Blend. Can't wait to find out!)"
"E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain."
"I found the content of the book very superficial. It deals with eliminating the symptoms of lack of motivation: things like ""Kill your television"", ""Read yourself a story""... (these are chapters titles from the book). Do not expect a deep philosophical of psychological insight about human motivation or even human nature in general from this book."
"This arrived in a different package and bottle than shown. The box has tear marks and is beat up. It also has a nasty, dirty spot where some sort of sticker was removed. What a great looking Christmas gift this will make."
This is the worst film of all time. The only amusement came from making fun of the acting. How they got Liam Neeson and Zeta Jones to be in this movie is incredible. I was looking forward to bathroom breaks so I would miss some of this movie. Total poop!!
"Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are the terrific duo in this dancing romance on the road! I love the song Baby, when she is teaching him the cha-cha! I definatly recommend this movie to everybody. A time-less classic!"
"I dont know what the lower guys issues with his connection are, I have 0 issues with ping, mine is always in the 130 range. Maybe you should stop DLing porn while playing multiplayer games.This is a great game, very fast paced and enjoyable. You can choose to enter any type of vehicle, while being more arcade than simulation, the action and craziness are well worth the low price offered by EA games..."
"The dialogue in this novel is as stilted and ridiculous as its characters. Here's the premise: a grown man with a successful career in education meets the mother of one of his students and, after a few seconds, he's madly and deeply in love, the dilemma on which the rest of the plot depends. I was expecting the main character to metamorphse into a serial killer but it doesn't happen. This book is not worth anyone's time. It's author obviously thought writing a good book wasn't worth her time and it's definitely not worth yours."
It is my girls first year in ballet so I just wanted an inexpensive bag. If you want a really nice bag don't waste your money here. The entire bag is made of urethane and has a cheap feel. The biggest positives are the cute graphics and the straps work well.
Nothing better than learning a Bible Lesson through so much entertainment. I wish there were more DVD's out like this. Enjoy!
Based on a true story? If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy. Did anyone witness this woman being raped? People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men. They didn't have the DNA Test back then and when it did come about a lot of women were found guilty of lying about being raped.Since when is it all right for anyone to take the law into their own hands? I guess it was 1978 when it started for women or maybe before. You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him. This is sexist and sick.
"This movie, though it tells a compelling story, it simply filled with drudgery. I have not read the book, and still may, but I also consider the story line to be absolutely full of a race-baiting mentality. I do not recommend ""Snow Falling on Cedars."""
"one of the best albums....................ever. any genre, any era. my god, what a knock out. this is the latest musical persona of will oldham (whose illustrious career began as ""palace/palace music/palace brothers"") and many say it's his greatest achievement yet. i knew within ten seconds of first hearing this record that it had to be true. every song reaches in and squeezes the heart, gets all tangled up in your insides. you know what's great about this record? every single haunting track is memorable and affecting. every one. there isn't a single track that fades into the background...and that is a rare treat these days. and the fact that a tune as staggeringly vibrant as ""a minor place"" can co-exist so easily with smothering odes like ""i see a darkness"" is just amazing. it is, in many ways, like life."
every since i have seen on on tv i been scared.it's sounds wierd too.i don't like the music maker.get an idog
"This the second book I have read of his, and it was well paced and kept my interest.Plan on reading more of his work."
"It pains me to write anything negative about David Mead's work as I highly value and wholeheartedly recommend his other books, in particular ""The Ten Minute Guitar Workout"", ""Basic Guitar Workout"", and ""Rhythm - A Step by Step Guide to Understanding Rhythm for Guitar"". These are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well.But then there's this book. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as concise as his other works. In fact, I read it three times and still felt rather confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but when it comes to explaining the CAGED system of organizing the fretboard, which is ultimately what this book is about, I learned more in 14 pages of Bill Edward's excellent Fretboard Logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover.Buy Mead's other books, especially if you're an intermediate or beginner. But if you want to master the fretboard, get Fretboard Logic. There is no other."
"I started reading it, but couldn't continue when I found out that the ""Facts"" were being altered by Kerry and Brinkley. In the meantime, read ""Unfit for Command"". It gives several excerpts from this book anyway. Then maybe when the new version of the NON fiction comes out I'll read it. Although, I thought NON fiction was truth and truth couldn't be changed... I guess it depends on whose truth it is. I gave it one star because it's pretty thick and I think it probably took a lot of imagination to come up with that much."
"These run VERY large and do not fit correctly because of this. However, for the price, I still think they are a great bargain. They are very heavy duty and will probably last many years. They are also very warm. Almost too warm here in southen California. Those people in cold climates would LOVE them! Anyhow, I would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit. But I just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine."
"This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions."
I do not have any problems with Amazon...But I have problem with FireWallSalesNew York.I had return this TIVO almost three weeks ago.

Ihad wrote to them different times to see if they got my TIVO.They writeback to tell that they will let me know.Now it's going to a month and stillhave not resolved the problem.I think that I am going to better businessin the state of New York.I am very upset with this company.They have noPride if they did they would of taken care of me......Noris
"I have the original issue CD on the Universal Music label,11-11-1992. This CD has a different issue date, different cover pic, different label,(Polygram) and completely different track layout and missing tracks.(Universal=15 tracks, Polygram=12). The original tracks were: 1.It's Crazy 2.How Did He Look 3.Let There Be Love 4.Close Enough For Love 5.The End Of A Love Affair 6.Bewitched, Bothered, And Bewildered 7.I wish You Love 8.You've Changed 9.I Only Have Eyes For You 10.A Mark On Your Mind 11.I Love You For Sentimental Reasons 12.Maybe September 13.Do It Again 14.More Love 15.Les Feuilles Mortes.What in the world is going on here?My CD is a bit beat up,(I've played it so much), and I can't find another copy anywhere. Can anyone help?"
"I think that the only reason that the manufacturer recommends this ""toy"" for ages 6 and up is to avoid a law suit, they don't want to be responsible for any baby drownings or injuries. The only thing I can think of that my 7 year old would do with this is to play water frisbee. I used to like products from this manufacturer but if they cannot even stand behind their own product safety then it is time to make a return. Don't buy this if you haven't yet, it is not worth your babies safety."
"Having heard so many wonderful things about this film, I expected a lot. I was quite disappointed - great cast but not great acting. I was bored through most of it and not even Russell Crowe was worth watching. He is most brilliant in ROMPER STOMPER!GLADIATOR certainly does not measure up to the great SPARTACUS!!!"
"Like dune, it is flawed, spending too much time on internal monologue and exposition better left to the reader. Also like Dune, it is brilliant in many ways--symbolism, philosophy, intrigue, etc. I think one of the reasons that people didn't like it as much as Dune was because they were expecting more of the same and got, instead, a very changed universe (with several contradictions). Sequels in far-future sci fi always lack the wonder of discovering a new world; but in a way, watching the development is just as fascinating. If you liked Dune, read Dune Messiah."
"I first heard of these guys in a short article of Guitar World and later found this CD at a music show for pretty cheap and decided to pick it up. While the songs are very heavy complete with loud vocals, humorous lyrics, heavy fast power chords, and screaming solos, what do you expect from a 90's punk band? NP proves to the world, that they play what they want to and not what the public wants to hear. Their live shows sound very interesting complete with a fire-breathing bassist and crazy stage antics. If you like it loud and fast, give this one a try! You gotta love the cover too, heh."
"This movie was even funnier than the first. I love how they brought back characters from the first movie and continued storylines. Definitely recommended, but you need to make sure you see the first movie before this one. :)I'd stop after this one though, Tremors 3 was pretty bad."
"Not one of the stronger entries in the series, SLAVES OF OBSESSION suffers from too many set pieces and not enough of the emotional complexity usually found in this series. Far too much time is spent on the philosophical battle between Union and Confederate issues; battles better detailed in many other works, and not enough on developing a strong narrative. The trip to America for Monk and Hester to recapture an American and his runaway English teen on a charge of murder is relatively ridiculous and only serves as an opportunity for Perry to showcase Hester's nursing ability. It's an interesting scene, but really just fills pages and does not move the narrative forward. Even the mystery's solution resolution left me less than satisfied, a perfunctory ending to a pedestrian entry in the series."
"The bag of grass seed has'nt sprouted diddley, I've got pictures , it's the perfect weather and the rain is consistant, and to top it off, Iuse miricle grow garden soil of which I have pictures and reciepts !!!!IT'S GARBAGE ,PROBABLY LEFT OVER FROM LAST TEARS SALES....."
"It would be safer to have just held my son. We thought this was cool becasue we wouldn't have to blow it up, but no....that's not the problem, now the problem is he just falls forward so his face is in the water....! I'd much rather waste my breath to blow up a floater so my son can keep his breath free of water. Nice waste of money, if they ever redesign this, the need to try to make it more stable. It's not like we just stuck him in there once & gave up on it, we've tried this thing over & over again months upon months to see if maybe it was his age...nope it's the item, even when other children try it, it's the same thing. Please don't buy this & look away from your child for a second, you could be making a horrible mistake."
This is a workbook-for both those comtemplating death or planning for it as an eventuality. It is also an instructional book on various methods of dealing with property so that one's wishes are fulfilled after death. Even young adults should have this to help parents or friends deal with loved ones with fatal or potential fatal diseases.
"There are not enough stars in the sky, and no words I can say here that will do it justice."
"This Kindle version of the book has quite a few typographical errors. I could usually make them out, but it IS irritating. This review is for this version of the book not ""Boots And Saddles"" itself (which I found to be a very enjoyable read!)."
This is the only brand of Lory food our flock will accept. Its fruity smell and apparent good taste are the first thing our lories want in the morning and they get very excited waiting for their individual bowls to be passed out.
"8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running."
"I ordered this, based on the reviews. I ordered on 11/16, and received it on 11/21 (I needed it by 11/29). I love the musky smell. I only tested 1 drop on my wrist. I have to say that after a couple of hours, the smell turned into a strong sex smell... not bad, but definitely sex. I'm going to test it out at work next week, but the real test is on 11/30. I'll report my findings then.12/6/12: It works! This is definitely going to be my ""go-to"" scent. It drove my man crazy! I love it. I will purchase again."
"Even if you know a lot of this stuff, it's bracing (to say the least) to see it all presented at once. It's the kind of book that may permanently taint your view of the future, and/or get you to start making worst-case-scenario plans in the event that ""all the wheels come off at once"".Especially interesting were the chapters on the history of ""mainstream"" and ""outsider"" churches in the US over the past two centuries (definitely a neglected topic, as the author points out) and the ""southernization"" of America. If Mr. Phillips' sterling credentials and decidedly non-left orientation aren't enough to convince you that this isn't a biased, one-sided polemic, you're probably unreachable."
"This is a great book for ALL levels of experience.If you're just starting your career as an account executive this wonderfully outlines many things you can do to instantly improve your client relations. And if you've been working with clients for a long time this will serve as an invaluable reference. You shouldn't just read it once, but over and over again!It's a quick read that can make a huge impact on your career and clients."
"Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well."
"Via Amazon - Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again."
"I have been taking these for 6 months- I don't love taking 6 tabs a day, but they seem to work best when you do. The price is better then some of the other products on the market also."
"This film really misses its mark. Billed as a black comedy, it fails to deliver any satirical bite whatsoever. Suzanne Stone's frequent video segments where she speaks directly to the camera and the flashforwards to some sort of Jerry Springer-like show are painful to watch. Yeah, Nicole Kidman is extremely sexy (duh), but it's not nearly enough to overcome her marginal acting, the clumsy dialog and the amateurish direction.See this movie for all the humor of ""Dying Young"" coupled with the social commentary of a SpongeBob episode."
I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!
"This was a awesome book, that focused a lot of it's attention on Dairine, Nita's annoying younger sister. Since I myself have an eleven year old brother who irritates me quite a lot (though I'll admit he's not as bad as Dairine) I found myself truly resenting Dairine's character in the other books. But, since this book told a lot of the story from her point of view, I began to dislike her less, and finally in the end I realized I identified with her quite a bit. This book was definitely the best in the series, both in character development and in writing quality. The Lone Power is such a cool foe! Kind of like the dark side of the Force except it's more solid than that. This book would be good for anyone who likes fantasy, and even those who don't might change their minds reading this books like these."
"The problem with this book, is that you cannot argue for copyrights on one hand, and against them on the other. Either there is intellectual property or there is not. If there is not, then it is a government granted monopoly, and government granted monopolies can be shown to be less efficient then the market. As such, this means that copyrights would not do a better job at encouraging ingenuity. The thing is the book seems to talk about the philosophy of it a lot more then the reality of it."
"When i first got this book from the library i put it down after 3 pages. At the time it had looked to me like a big, boring book. I brought it home again to give it another chance (like 2 years later) and I think it's great. The story is good, bringing magic into a world you are most familiar w/ and even entering more worlds. The story of 13 year old girl mixed with another boy is weaved together of them trying to learn magic. Just novices, they are experimenting w/ Speech that leads them to a lot of trouble. I think Duane had a great idea, and even if it's not as exciting as some other books, it's worth it."
"I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer- what is the point of this boxed set? I have YesYears as well, and almost every other Yes cd. This boxed set adds very little that is new, and might only be worth buying for someone without any Yes cd's, or who is new to listening to the band. Other boxed sets (Jethro Tull, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, etc.) were done very well by their respective record companies, and make a lot of sense.The one good thing about this box set is that (supposedly) all the music was remastered. If Rhino goes back and re-releases some of Yes's albums with bonus tracks (as they are doing for the band Chicago), I would definitely be interested in buying that."
"I have read every Elric novel. I own 500 kilos of fantasy paperbacks. This book brought me as much joy, inspiration and satisfaction as any book I have ever read. Elric was the first ""evil"" hero. Every fantasy writer has taken a peice of elric to produce their characters. Drizt Do'urden is a shadow of Elric. Raistlen is almost an exact copy of Elric. Darth vader's sinister life, dependence on technology/sorcery and eventual noble self sacrifice are in mimicry of Elric. In this book so many authors who wanted to write Elric stories, some who had made great fame and fortune copying Moorcock, were given licence to write as they pleased. Every short story in the book is its authors best work because as they write about their own dark heros in their own novels they are thinking about Elric. My highest praise: I want a sequel.. or two... or ten... a series published monthly untill I am old and grey."
"I would not reccomend this book. It was very boring and I didn't find much of a purpose. The end was the best part, but it was still bad. l did not get into this book or enjoy it. it was for school."
"The design of this basketball system is fantastic. It is so easy to move and so easy to raise or lower the backboard. It is sturdier than most movable systems and with the 4 wheels and the leaver action you can easily move it from one place to the other without emptying the reservoir. If it is a windy day you can easily lower the back board. Now that I have raved about the product let me give you the negative, if you are not mechanically inclined, do not even attempt to put this together. The directions are terrible and there are a lot of moving parts. After putting it together there are a lot of left over nuts and bolts and you wonder what you have forgotten, but the directions are very bad so you had to guess at what they meant. So I recommend that you hire someone to put this together which is what we had to do to get this put up. Took the person many hours to get it together and he was not working by an hourly rate."
"I remember back as a teenager watching ""A Current Affair"" when Maury Povich was still the host. There was a story on this very movie because the opening scene was filmed at a high school and consisted of 20 or so scantilly clad women and a voluptuous teacher that greeted the hero with the line, ""Is that an apple in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?"" Obviously, this was a dream sequence, but nontheless, I think that alone was worth the $3.00 I paid for this movie. The rest is pretty much mind-numbing."
"""What secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges-maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous Wellingtonia Sequoia;went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she wasbarely in her tricklies; was well known to claud a conciliationcap onto the esker of his hooth""If I wrote this and attempted to pass this off as a novel, no one would ever read it. If they did, they would correctly assume that I am, in fact, a pompous erudite fool. And by the way, I know that there are a million academics rating this book that will come on here and tell me how completely wrong my point of view is. But guess what?--I don't care and I'll never actually read any of your responses. Save it for your poor students and old, bearded friends wearing tweed jackets with elbow patches.To the rest of you (normal people)--stay away from this book."
"I love Marilyn Manson!But... after watching this movie, I had a change of thoughts. If you like to see band members vomiting, band members deficating, and then playing with it, people rubbing stuff against their bare naked d*ck, and other profanity, you should buy this movie. I thought it would just be a movie of their tour, but it's a bunch of s**t. Stick to the CD's. By the way, I think Courtney put a hell of a show on at the tour! Manson... a bit sick. I still think that Manson kicks, but some of the stuff he does just disgustes me so much, and makes me think just what he's puting in the minds of our youth today. You think about it. The shootings at that school for instance..."
"seams to be growing well so far, Just needed plenty of water and it took a week and a half for the first sprouts to show up, just do reserch to make sure it will grow in your location."
"For the first time in my life, I wish I had a VHS copy even with the DVD released. I first noticed a problem when the first spider dies in the movie, and there is no vortex sound effect. Then the entire scene in Lake Town is... muted. The arrows are silenced, the dragon roars as a mouse, and the fire, it crackles as a loud annoyance. I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing, now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD. I will be buying the VHS shortly."
"The noval ""Lord of the flies"" written by William Golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read. I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done,also there seemed to be no remorse for death.But that is easily forgotton because of the intensity of this great book . Not only is this book entertaining and colorful but its also got a not so easily seen message.But through symbolism and getting to know the characters you will find that this book makes you see your society and yourself in a whole new way."
"This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world."
"I purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition. The only problem I had was the black pieces. They were somehow discolored on every one. This problem was not present on the white. Everytime I play it the black pieces bother me. I would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces. I feel that I should not have to pay since this set was not cheap. Please advise.Thanks,Gary H."
"...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there, that's done."
"Strikes me as too soon to produce reliable history about a period so recent. He seemed a hair right-of-center but at least didn't fall into the mythology of Reagan ""winning"" the cold war. He mentions Clinton as ""slick"" a couple times but in his previous 1945-74 history I don't think (memory may be wrong) he ever used Tricky Dick or Slippery Richard about Nixon."
"L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!"
"Lots of interesting examples but too many of them seem to come from a right-wing perspective. Also the book, which is humorless, reminds me of other better-done accounts of the same areas. The lessons of the book should be applied to the book itself. It doesn't fare well if this is done."
Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!
"This translation of Marquez's quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years' symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration, political upheaval, and social transition. One criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical, cultural, or social elements of life in Colombia in the past two centuries.""Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude"" (p. 199).Overall, a great read!"
"It starts off a bit slow, but once the product placement jokes start it takes off."
"I would give this one 0 star if Amazon allowed me.I read all the good reviews on this DVD and decided to get a copy. Luckly we had one from the local library.After I reviewed the library copy, I am completely shocked that someone can produce a DVD like this one and call it ""Tai Chi"". It is not even half way close.The demonstrator didn't even get his movement right. In fact the content of the DVD is a set of morning exercise combining a little bit of everything possibly Asian: primary school morning exercise, some basic Yoga breathing and postures, some partial Tai Chi gesture. Coming from an Asian background, I almost felt this is an insult.If you are serious about learning Tai Chi, don't get misled by this DVD."
"... it's become my favorite video. Joan Blondell and Carole Landis--the ""poor man's Betty Grable""--are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that Landis has been awarded. Billy Burke as Mrs. Topper is a scream and so is her side-kick maid, Patsy Kelly (no one could do a double-take better than patsy) and Rochester, as Cosmo Topper's man servant is hysterical. The beautiful camera-work, the women's gowns, the top-notch special effects and the hysterical sight-gags ranks this with the best of Abbott and Costello comedies. A terrific excuse to while away an hour and a half when you're feeling down or bored. Best Scene: the playful seal and Rochester."
"Although they appeared to be working (they glowed, and we'd hear the occasional ZAP) it didn't take 6 months before one of them completely stopped glowing, and they made no dent at all in the mosquito population - the reason we bought them. Not worth it at all."
"This product is horrible. We own a Belkin and it works, unlike this wireless adapter. I thought I'd try this one since it's smaller and a bit less money, but it doesn't doesn't pick up any signal from our modem, and the modem is across the hall in the next room. In addition, I bought it from State Street Deals, and they won't let us return it because it's been opened. How else would we find out it doesn't work? Definitely NOT a great product, or merchant. I'd avoid both at any cost."
"Please don't waste your time or money purchasing this book. Our book club decided to read it based on it's ""good"" reviews. Only one person out of six finished it (just to get it done). The language is foul and the story is boring and drags on, which makes it difficult to follow and finish. Two stars is being generous."
GoFit Vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together. We use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball. It still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back. Highly recommend!!
"this is by far the worse horror movie ever. the acting is pATHETIC, THE KILLER IS A total idiot, the camera footage suckz and theres no story line that goes with it, itz just about a guy that kills people with a chainsaw. i rented this movie and instantly regreted it. PLEAZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer screwed"
"My 7 & 9 year olds love this game - and we have gotten it for all of their friend's birthdays, too. They love trying to come up with items to stump the computer... it keeps them busy and gets them thinking."
This cd blows nothing worth listening to. Really sucks the big unit. One of there worst cds.thank you very muchyour welcome
"THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON'S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM."
"This book was really fun. It was action-packed. The beginning was a little odd, at least to me, but the rest of the story kept me interested.Since it's an older story, it's really great for adults like me who love ""old-school"" sci-fi. My son wasn't grabbed by it, by the way. So not sure if it's great for kids."
"The first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was 'odious' but I'll do it a bit of a service and say it's merely *trying.* I watched it on Amazon instant (I like the service but keep in mind I am no hard-core cinephile, my concern is the story alone, not so much the technology) and made it through to the end.I felt rather ragged afterwards. The character of Milton left perhaps the biggest impression on me - he looked and sounded and acted like a Muppet, particularly Beaker. That was a very trying element in this film. I felt like I was watching a strange permutation of James Thurber's The Catbird Seat, told in a backwards way from some unimportant background characters.The protagonist didn't feel like a protagonist. The only really wonderful piece of acting was that of Mr. Lumberg, whose dry, grueling ""that would be great,"" stole the show. It was grotesque and hilarious.Otherwise, this was a legitimately unsatisfying film. I don't plan on watching it again."
"I couldn't wait to see this movie because of so many good reviews. But .... Without having read the reviews or other synopsis', I wouldn't have had a clue what was happening in the movie. There were so many flashbacks in the middle of scenes you never knew where you were. I like Christian Bale,but his fine acting was lost in the fancy editing. And as for Katie Holmes, her acting was like a piece of cardboard. Thank goodness someone loaned me the movie and I didn't have to pay for it. What a disappointment. Sorry, because I know the other reviews are great, but you must have been watching another movie."
"OK, I'm not going to get into this movie's lack of similarities to the video games;this movie just plain sucks. I can't see why anybody over the age of twelve can enjoy this piece of you know what. Come on, this movie has horrible acting, a dreadfully bad story and ""hilariously"" unfunny jokes. I think you people who gave this movie five stars really need professional help, 'cause one star is far too generous. I'm not saying all the media incarnations of mario sucked;the cartoons were actually pretty good. But this movie, in my opinion is what caused that chain of cartoons to end."
"Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can't think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you'll ever hear... can't say it's not original, but in this case that's not necessairly a good thing. If you're not familiar with this band, this probably wouldn't be the best album to start with."
IT DOESENT HAVE A HOLE IN THE BACK FOR THE CABLES THATS THE DOWN SIDE THATS IT U HAVE TO MAKE A HOLE AND THE AMP DIDNOT FIT HAD TO CUSTOM FIT CUTS IN FOR THE SPEAKER CABLES
"I ordered the movie Office Space, but when I received it I had Happy Gilmore in an ""Office Space"" package. It was sealed and everything. I was very disappointed in Amazon's service, in sending me the wrong movie! Will not do that again!"
"I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment."
"Let this illogical hack please not defend my party, and makea case against the liberals. She doesn't get it, and makesso many ridiculous arguments that don't hold up.Her writing style is horrendous. Please do not wastetime on this book. I would give this rating a negative 2 starsif I could."
"I believe that the author's purpose in the ""The Lord of the Flies"" was to show that without laws, there would be chaos in the world. To show that authority is trully needed in the world . I agree one hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences for people who refuse to listen to authority. The literary element that Golding handled the best was symbolism. For example, the conch was a symbol of authority and power. When the conch was broken , there was no authority , but complete chaos. This book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful. The only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to understand. If I had written the book. I wouldn't have used such large discriptive words But "" The Lord of the Flies"" was a good book and I would recommend it to my friends or anyone looking for a good book to read."
The book is too long and contains some unnecessary kill-crazy parts. Certainly good for historical reference but I wouldn't reccomend this as a source of spiritual or even moral inspiration.
This battery operated little jewel allows playing of old 78's and stillsounds reasonable in it's single onboard speaker mode. It also has thestandard stereo outputs to drive an external soound system for all threeRPMs. All this and it's built to pack around.My wife called it one of the best electronics purchases I've ever made..
"Does anyone say ""Crazy getup""? If they do, I wish they wouldn't. There's too many examples of bad cliche writing in this that I don't have time to point them all out. I was looking for a good time travel romance. This isn't it."
"I don't care how much Elgar you have, this should be in your library. The composer's rendition of his Second is one of the best. It should be considered a standard. You might also be taken with the ancient version of the Cello Concerto. The sad, rugged atmosphere is captured."
"I purchased this through Prime as an extra Christmas gift for the household. We haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I've seen the movie before. It's one of the best movies ever, and I won't even say what I paid for it on here because I don't know what they're asking for it now. I just know that I got an exceptional deal, I think it was a gold box or something. I'm looking forward to watching this version to see what the special flair is all about, but I did get a great price on this, shipping was fast through prime and I'm happy with my purchase."
"Death, Society, and the Human Experience is a wonderful textbook! I have been using it in my class The Sociology of Death and Dying for the past four years. This book provides the information necessary to any real understanding and examination of societal assumptions and attitudes toward death and dying. It not only enhances the knowledge of the student but provides the groundwork for new readers in the field. The book is a beautiful presentation of stimulating facts that will help everyone confront death and dying in a more personal and lasting manner."
"I cannot believe that there are actually reviewers who actually Liked this film! This Film was a Mammoth FAILURE on ALL LEVELS! The Script was terrible, there was really no story whatsoever and it just didnt make sense! Sean Penn To me is the greatest actor of our generation but this was his WORST PERFORMANCE! Sean's Southern accent was SO BAD that I had to actually turn on the English Subtitles to understand him. This Movie just didnt make sense and was full of holes that were never filled or explained by the movies end(and I CLAPPED when the film FINALLY ENDED)! The Only Good Performances were by James Gandolfini who was very Convincing(made me totally forget Tony Soprano) and patricia clarkson ws Good! Do Not waste Two Hours of your life watching this garbage! Go Buy The Original Version which is a Classic and Far Superior!"
I was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore. They do not sell the part. Beware. It is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable. I had it for 10 months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice. The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months. This is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just won't last.
"It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of ""real life"" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a ""good enough"" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting."
"This has to be the most boring album of all time. Right up there with Yield, Riot Act and No Code. I don't know what it's going to take for this band to finally call it quits. They have no talent and their lead singer just mumbles into the microphone -- you can't understand a word he's saying.If you're looking for a fresh sound, you can't go wrong with a band like Creed. They're talented and they have passion for their work -- not like these washed up has-beens. Pearl Jam has no real talent. Warning: this album is horrible. Listen to the song previews and you'll agree with me."
Good shipping but the pages were screwed up! At about 170 it reverts back to 79 and repeats 40 pages leaving 40 pages of the novel out! Terrible! How the hell did this happen! Check the pages.
"All I have to say is that I love it! The music is awesome, still love Donny Osmond and he's excellent in this production."
"The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way, I wouldn't know as that I am running on a laptop with a vertical resolution of 480 dpi. When running at this resolution, the bottom of the dialogue boxes are chopped off - scroll bars, lists of words, et al - instead of resizing as would be expected of even a sub-par user interface.And tech-support's response to my dilemma? Increase your resolution. Sorry, it's a laptop with a fixed resolution; not an option. Guess I'm stuck with Encarta's less-than-inspiring definitions of words."
"I have several other pairs of slippers for winter, and these are my absolute favorite. they're so warm and comfortable. My only two complaints though are that I'd like to see a more supportive footbed. Also, they do run a full size too small, so be sure to order one size up. I did so at the recommendation of the other reviewers, and they were right. The sole of the slipper is also non-slip."
Very enjoyable you can never stop because this book is filled with suspends and cold hangers this was a great book
"Wonderful intro...author clearly explains that if the readers want a more difficult route they can go with Syn Field's books, but this book will get you off and running & thinking about the task of screenwriting. For what the author intends to do, I give her 5stars.The Inner Movie Method is the start of your journey to writing a screenplay or to just understanding the movies you see better. It's concise, upbeat & ""can do"" in spirit.Accessible. Short Chapters. Exercises. Some good summaries. I like her overview of the stages of life & movie theme that concern each.A pleasure to read. Guaranteed to enhance your movie going experience.But again... this is a place to begin."
"What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
"I was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced English in high school. I ordered it for my son, because no one can be considered well read without this in one's history."
"I really hate this movie. It's so bad I can barely describe it in words. I despise any film that uses children as nothing more than sucker-punching props to inspire sympathy when they're completely undeveloped, like the rest of the characters in this trash.If you really wanna see what's in this movie, go to [...] to see my video review of it. Get ready to laugh."
"This is a shapeless sack with pockets. Absolutely no thought has gone into design. When you are carrying 40 lbs on you, distribution of weight becomes critical, else you are likely to end up with a major case of backache. Having used the vest a few times and each time spending the following day in bed, I can vouch that the manufacturer has spent no effort in designing the product. I have an Altius (20 lbs). What a wonderful vest!"
Excellent Service. Unit installed easily and worked perfectly like factory original. I would highly recommend this company for all your door opener needs.
"This book is so obscene in some parts, and its not even written by Naomi Campbell, but some filthy man. Dont pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak."
"I just wanted to add my voice to those who already mentioned the problems with paper feed. Not long after I bought this model (but too late to return)it started having problems with the paper feed. I now have to hand feed each piece of paper, and even then it sometimes doesn't work. The print quality is fine, but what good is it if you can't get the paper in. I now have to replace this ""new"" printer. That was a couple of hundred dollars wasted."
"This is an album that I will listen to again and again. Wonderful songs sung by a great voice. ""Touch"", ""I Will Carry You"" and ""Invisible"" are my faves. Pop music at its best!"
"Being forced to read it in school for its ""so called""relation to censorship (sp?) I would have to say !!BURN IT!! Althoughthe book is about censorship and why/how it is wrong I can't say much good about it. The theme itself is good, but the story itself is trash. One of the most un-realistic ideas i've ever heard. First off, everyone in the country is an idiot. Second, that includes the hero. Third, even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence. And finally, way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itself.L8r."
"these do a very, very good job. huggies supreme hold a bit more liquid but for the price the best you can get. actually like better than the pampers cruisers and they cost less. with the amount in the box - one case is good for almost a month. rarely leak - even w/ a 2 year old at night."
"Just another one of those movies. A bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs. Neither scary nor educational(Tommy, you are taking Anatomy 101, and believe me, this movie doesn't help you pass that class!). Many scenes are too dark to tell what happened. Hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen, and the next thing you know, someone has dropped. It is okay to see it for free, but not worth it when you pay for the ticket."
Simply the best picture of 2000 and perhaps for years. This is an instant classic... Russell Crowe sits with the greats like Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston. Get this DVD... even better get Ben Hur and Spartacus and have a Roman Marathon.
"Bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel. It's not a sequel to A Christmas Carol, as some readers assume. It's a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material, slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your Dickens, but in no way detract if you're just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thriller.Remarkable. Definitely a writer to watch."
It does not keep coffee very warm.I can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort.Hope that paints the picture you need.
"This Santana album has MediaMax copy protection software embedded in the CD. The problem with this CD is that the MediaMax program installs undisclosed--and in some cases, hidden--files on users' Windows computers, potentially exposing music fans to malicious attacks by third parties. The infected CDs also communicated back to the record company about customers' computer use without proper notification.This is unacceptable and it will make me think twice before buying another Santana album. Also, if the record company wishes to treat me like a criminal and take away the right to make a personal copy of music I purchase because of a few bad apples, then it should realize that it will lose its few remaining customers.Santana, please release this CD without these copy protection schemes and I will buy it. Thank you."
"I read this book over 13 years ago, and I tell you, it still remains one of my faves. Even though I was barely 13 when I read it, the book gave me hope and made me believe that anyone could become something, no matter their background and especially like Emma's."
"The lessons in the books of this series are classic,timeless and very much needed at this time. I wish every parent would read them to their children."
"Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilictions."
"If America is ever going to find the truth behind the failed Liberal race-policies, then every American has a moral obligation to read Jared Taylor's ""Paved With Good Intentions."" Indeed, Mr. Taylor has shown his courage in writing such a book, and he should be applauded for his nobel work. No doubt, there will be those who will claim that Mr. Taylor is a racist. But, the true racists are those who are attacking Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor unflinchingly tells the truth about race and crime and how Black racism is proliferating in America. If we are ever going to heal the already damaged race-relations in America, then it is time for us to speak the unspoken truth. God Bless Jared Taylor."
"When I first listened to ""The Way"" I loved it instantly. It's the kind of song you can sing along with hearing it for the first time. It is very catchy and very romantic. I think this should be his next single. Their will be some that don't like it because its not edgy enough. Who cares. I'm sick of the negative reviews. If they want to have edge and profanity in their music there are plenty of other artists out there to choose from. Sorry, for going off there. Anyway, I love ""The Way"" and I also really really like ""Touch"". Overall, I love the entire CD. I am going to play it until I memorize every word."
This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
"I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented, but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is. Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time. Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station, it doesnt even do that!! How stupid, does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it. Tsk Tsk. The product is also really dependent on the internet, so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker. Actually, even if you do have a cable or dsl line, its still useless."
"And here it is haha!As soon as I heard there was a movie about straight-edge kids coming out I freaked. First I thought it was goin to be like a Hollywood straight-edge thing where they'd confuse edge with emo or something and I didn't want to see some edgers whining about girls. But then I heard it was made in the NYHC so I was super excited when I saw it at Tower. The first half was ok it was kind of boring and there were black & white parts that I still don't know why they were black & white, but once the riot begins it goes off like nothing you've ever seen before. Props to the filmmakers for some violence that's as real looking as Boston Beatdown, which actually is real! I just wish they could have played Project X ""Straight-edge Revenge!"" during the riot haha O.L.D.!!!"
"This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled, I keep losing track of which character is being talked about. I have read and reread the story, but still have difficulty summarizing the story. The excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow. Use caution when reading this story."
"I purchased this in February 2012. It died in late July 2012. In that span of time I had used the gun perhaps 7-8 times for a total of no more than 2-3 hours of cumulative use. Then last Saturday the gun just died. I happened to notice a bit of sparking though the vents in the lower housing and then that was all they wrote for the heat gun.It does have a 2 year warranty, but for what it would cost me in shipping I would rather put that money towards another to replace it. Which is what I plan to do.Judging from other reviews on this heat gun it's pretty much hit and miss. You might get a good one or like a bad one. My suggestion? Look for a product that has far more hits than misses."
"I purchased this for my step-daughter who is a poker novice. I thought she would like to have her own poker set to play and practice. One week after receiving it, she informed me that the set already began falling apart. The hinge came off and it's literally falling apart on her.This was embarrassing because it was a gift from me. Now I must redeem myself and purchase a better set. Do not buy this piece of junk."
"The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film, but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine, who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate, and cannot change her feelings. This film explores the difference between the two, and the pain that one causes the other by his ""lightness of being"".Towards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker, so be ready to cry your eyes out."
All the credit card slots are to small for credit cards. I had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit.
"I did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said, and to make it even more objectionable, the audio level would overwhelm when the scene cut to an action event. The audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a Hi-Def monitor. It is suggested Amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old CBS Audiomax units like TV broadcasters used in the 60's to prevent the commercials' audio levels from annoying the viewers. Run ALL movies through an audio processor and get this under control.Jim"
how many of us read NIGHT FLIGHT in high school as quickly as possible? my grown experience of Saint-Exupery is the opposite. i linger over every page. Saint-Exupery provides a literary meal to be savored page by page. call me an escapist but the skies over Buenos Aires never looked so good.
"I was also disappointed with this book. I heard Oprah talking about how great it was, and I found it a struggle to read. I was easily distracted when reading this book. Overall, a big disappointment"
"This is apropos of the DVD version. This movie is pan and scan, despite what the description says and what it says on the back of the box. It is 1.33:1 format and even says at the beginning of the film: ""This film has been modified from its original format-It has been formatted to fit this screen."" If you got stung, demand a refund. What nitwit would release a film in an obsolete format?"
"Signature Killers was informative, educational, and kept me focussed and intrieged by the minds of criminals. By using different case studies, Robert Keppel brings into review some of the most disturbing crimes and analyzes the root and causes of these human diviances. A definate ""keeper"" in my books!"
I've read nearly all of them and this is my favorite. Definitely check out the ones with Death in a lead role (like Mort for instance)
"I love this movie...I love it because it lets me go back to 'visit' my Grandmother, who I miss every day of my life. But when I am watching this movie, I am somehow with her again, even if only for a few moments. It also lets me be a 'kid' again...remembering a time long gone by, but never quite forgotten. For me, this is a movie sprinkled with tears but rich with wonderful memories of yesterday. Let's face it, we all would love to go back to a previous time and place, even if just for a moment. This movie is the next best thing."
"This huge, collector's edition is HEAVY, the font is small, and there is a ridiculous amount of margin area for writing. I take copious notes, but this is even too much for me. So in effect, you buy this supposedly beautifuly collector's edition, but it's shiny paper back - what's so great about it? Nothing. I'm not even sure why it costs so much. I've seen numerous errors in spelling. The value doesn't equal what you pay for it. Go for the lighter editions, unless, like other reviewers, you buy this merely to sit on your shelf to impress people (or yourself).As for the book, Adam Smith is thorough, it's hard work to get through it, but his principles are sound and when left to work without government regulation, the precepts taught therein work beautifully. Smith gets five stars. The Premium Edition is lucky to get two."
"I had to read this for a high school summer reading list. It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation. While some themes are mildly interesting, there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time. This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books. This was the first book I ever read that truly took the joy out of reading for me."
"This is definately one of the most underrated books of all time. Many will believe that this book is about politics, but it is about life. Robert Penn Warren creates Jack Burden, a character who is more like a spectator then one who actually lives life. The writing style is wonderful, and some of the lines in this novel are extremely well written and created. I highly recommend this book to anyone who can survive the first chapter, it is definately worth it. Many themes can also be drawn from this book, a book that you will be thinking about long after you have finsihed."
"Being a huge Grisham fan, I could not wait to read The Last Juror. That quickly turned to being unable to wait to finish it! The book began great, but quickly changed. It just seemed like it did not know where it was going...so many things, too many things were going on. I'd pass on this one."
"I read the Julie/Julia Project blog occasionally and enjoyed it. I thought that the book would be similar, but it wasn't. I don't object to irreverent opinions and random stories in a foodie memoir, but she took out too much of what made the blog fun and what she replaced it with lacks wit and charm. Powell's writing feels forced and her contrived expositions of how hip, liberal, and shocking she is/wants to be pall quickly."
"This book, the Cry of the Humble, is written with a purpose. It wants to be a compilation of different and short subjects. Who has time to read 600 page books and, besides the other daily rememberances, to be able to recall what you have read yesterday? This book treats most every situation one can meet in life in short recall. Put the book in your grip, read a couple pages while waiting for the bus or any other occasion."
"If you enjoyed the book, you won't want to watch the Disney version of this movie. Characterization was changed (a friendly dwarf became a nasty grump, Prince Caspian and King Peter had jealousy issues); scenes were added that weren't in the book, and basically all of the best parts of the book were omitted. There were battles that never took place. In fact, fighting was the main focus of this movie. Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie. If Disney wanted to create a fantasy battle movie, they should have just hired someone to write one. Prince Caspian is definitely NOT the Prince Caspian that C.S. Lewis wrote. I will definitely not watch any more Disney adaptations of Narnia."
"I was excited to read this book based on the reviews, my love of history. I was extremely disappointed. The characters here are one dimensional, uttering predictable catch-phrases, and are basically uninteresting. I got through about 200 pages and couldn't even finish. The main character is increadibly driven, and consequently his reactions throughout the story become entirely predictable. He has no depth and the author doesn't create any kind of sympathy, empathy, or interest between the character and the reader. I really didn't care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book. I think I'll stick with Bernard Cornwell, or Sharon Kay Penman."
"Catspaw was my introduction to Cat. Like other reviewers, I expected a bit of lite fluff to while away a boring afternoon, and got Paydirt with a capital 'P'. Vinge's creation, whom she called in an interview the embodiment of her sense of outrage at social injustice, is on my personal list of favorite literary characters of all-time. Read the book and find out why."
"I bought this bed recently for my 9 year old lab mix. He doesn't dig, chew or abuse things in any way, so I wasn't concerned with getting a super abuse-proof bed. But after a couple of weeks of limited use I found a hole in the soft side of the bed. The fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate, but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying. It may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials. Very disappointing."
I bought this because of the men's health endorsement. My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted. It's ok for intercourse but not other activities.
"Length:: 6:20 MinsThis is my video Review of Stargate Continuum. For more video reviews, search ""MikePetel"" on Youtube. Enjoy!"
"This Album Offers Absolutely Nothing Worth Wasting Time With. Shaw Had One Minor #33 Hit With ""Girls With Guns"", But Nothing On This One. People Forget That Shaw Only Contributed One Top 40 Hit (Too Much Time...) On His Final Three Albums With Styx, Before They Broke Up. Without Nugent And Blades His Career May Have Ended Here."
"After having a lot of trouble finding a wedding band for my small ring finger, I decided on this one. This is the 4th ring I've tried. It fits nicely and looks fine with my small diamond solitaire. Has a good amount of sparkle but definitely doesn't look expensive. Don't let anyone look too closely!"
"Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet, in my opinion. The fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story.Shakespeare's words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story. The cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes!You will enjoy this movie ... again, and again ... I highly recommend it!"
Inaudible particularly for Gollum's talking and some of the songs. Glitches appear in the taping including soem sections where the sound drops off for a second in the middle of a sentence. Not re-digitized. Not worth it. Perhaps other reviews refer to a different version of the movie.
"This is not an appropriate book for children! As a child, I myself found it highly disturbing. Although the pictures are cute, I would never allow my child to read it."
"First, I will be upfront: I didn't get very far in this movie. There are few movies that I will stop in the middle (in fact, I can't think of any), but this was one of them. I was very disappointed with this movie. It makes fun of Jane Austen. It criticizes everything about Jane Austen's time period. Everything in the movie seemed designed to mock, from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections. It blatantly attacks Christianity ( or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them, by keeping your wedding vows). As strange as it sounds, I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen. It is a movie full of lies. Particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out. The opposite is true. Hopefully, the movie improved by the end, but I couldn't make it that far to find out."
"I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box."
"This isn't on the level of Kangaroo Jack or Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, but it'll do."
This Dvd is amazing. Braid is rock at its finest. If you get a chance you must see them on their reunion tour. The extras are hands down the best on any live dvd I have seen. This knocked the Impossibles Never Say Goodbye Dvd out of my player finally.
"The book has a lot of detailed step by step information on how the author runs his consulting business; however, he comes across as a greedy egomaniac. I was unimpressed. One chapter in the book suggests developing passive income like writing books. I was upset that I bought this books to feed this man's ego and revenue stream. Consider the Patrick Lencioni book series instead."
"The new Resident Evil Outbreak is boring. I expected it to be action-packed, boy was I wrong. Every level has like 0-3 zombies. I RENTED THE GAME TO SHOOT ZOMBIES, NOT INFECTED ANIMALS. My advice, try it at a friends house or play a demo first."
"Well as a student of History, this movie is to say the least, pittiful. The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable. The young women who plays Joan, should go back to acting school, she only seems to have two levels crazy, and crazy screaming. The only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes."
I was laughing so hard when I was reading this that I kept waking him up. I then tried not laughing and my body was shaking so much that that woke him up.This is a wonderfully funny book and I hope to read more books by Robin Wells.
"I have been using Pampers wipes pretty much from the beginning and I really love the pop-up tub and the different fragrances they come in. These sensitive ones are especially good for newborns. My only complaint is they are thin. I usually use 2 at a time, more if my son has a messy diaper. I recently tried Huggies wipes and they are thicker, but they don't pop up. I don't like reaching in the tub as much as a the pop up, so I guess I'll stay with these."
"Contrary to other review, I found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever."
Robin Hood was my children's all time favorite! I still sing those songs in my head. So glad we can share this with our grands.
"I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all."
"This is one of my favorite books of all time. The shocking sinking of the Essex (the inspiration for Moby Dick) is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut-wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation, thirst and madness as they try to make it from the middle of the Pacific back to South America. Philbrick's writing is clear, powerful and incredibly engaging. It's a hard book to both put down and get out of your mind after finishing it."
"I was looking for a good walking sandal that could be adjusted in case my feet were swollen (as often happens after flying). These were comfortable right away, the size was good, wore them every day and they were always comfortable, no blisters forming. Very happy with them, and would purchase other Propet products."
"Difficult to win anything on your own. $$$ outlay by individual players is too large. Better start a pool at the office with co-workers and collect funds in order to play any of her wheeling systems. You'll share winnings and losses (small and both sides unless you hit the Jackpot). No other book comes close. Get your rabbit's foot, or any other totem for luck! You'll need it."
"I think this is a great set - the lights are small and easy to install (the rear light easily fits on my Topeak rack), but these lights are better for being seen than seeing. That's great for the rear light: it does its job well. But the front light could use a little more horsepower if you intend on lighting the way."
"I wasn't looking for a book on why men leave... but on the fear of commitment. I have enjoyed this author's other book about Zen and falling in love... and browsing the first pages intrigued me.I will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem. I think that certain people, for whatever reason, value their own personal freedom above anything else, yet everyone, of course, would like to have a loving partner to go through life with. I wish this book had more insight into how TWO people like this, male, female... whatever... can find freedom within the confines of relationship."
"It is a good introductory book on real options targeted at the audience of managers rather than experienced financial practitioners. Its contents covered financial options, binomial pricing and Black-Scholes model where the last ten chapters or so are case studies dedicated to applications of real options where it gives readers an idea how real options can be applied in diverse industries.It makes a good and easy read for anyone who wants a quick flavor of real options without going through too much of the horrible maths that derivatives and real options seems to have !I personally enjoy reading it from cover to cover."
"This is great if you have a 27 inch 4:3 Cathode Ray TV but if you have a 16:9 HDTV, beware, it will look terrible.Yes, the ""supervised by Tobe Hooper"" picture is great, on a small screen but the DVD is in 4:3 Letterbox not 16:9 Anamorphic so you have to ""zoom"" it to watch on an HDTV and it will look terrible. It's like putting in an old VHS cassette, one that's really deteriorated.I am waiting, anxiously, for a real widescreen version for the modern HDTV audience."
"I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book."
"The Soka Gakkai was forged out of the rubble of postwar Japan. This is the story of how a small group with a generally poor and ill membership overcomes the harshness of the environment and forged a new chapter of Buddhism. For the critic above one simple question, has anyone who has criticized the SGI done anything to help humanistic causes all over the world? The only thing critics have to offer is silence."
I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.
"I have a toshiba Blu ray player that's a year old and this Blu ray DVD would not play in my player because it's so new and apparently a 1 year old Blu ray player needs an upgrade that costs $40. So now I'm reluctant to buy Blu rays. I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now. I gave this DVD to a friend and I'm sure it's fine, so just don't get it unless you have a new Blu ray player."
I mistakenly purchased this due to the similarity with the cover and STALINGRAD - DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER. This turned out to be just a pointless documentary on STALINGRAD like so many that had gone before. My bad...
"The Clive Davis churned out anothere same ol', same ol'...like what David Foster did to Josh Groban....great voices with little to do. The singer can be great but if the material is mostly wrong...oh, well....I will hope for better next time!"
"Never have I been so bored by a novel set in Ireland. While I found the historical aspect to be informative, the story itself was tedious and silly, with the most contrived fictional characters. I struggled to pick this book up each night (rather than put it down). I would rather read a straight history book and visit Dublin for my facts, and leave the Irish fiction to Emma Donoghue and even Maeve Binchy."
"By film's end, I was hoping the Driller Killer would show up to put Telly and Capser out of their misery. In the end, the only people you truly feel sorry for, is the man on the subway with no legs and the skater punk who gets beaten nearly to death."
"These pampers were the worst, my son was soaked. Every nightI Switched to o overnight ones which are great, no leaks"
"A curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book. I really like ""the Lover"", it's one of my favorite book to recommand others, even though I don't like much Duras.The writing is so short, like pieces of puzzle, there is no order to explain. Duras wrote what she felt, thought spontaneously in a paragragh after another. This book is descriptive and the flow of feelings is so delicate. Especially, the reflections about the life that Duras explained in this story, are truly profound and even sorrowful for me.There is no tension, no exposed conflict, the story moves so still like the calm ocean. The tranquility in rich thoughtful description, that's why I like this novel."
"Well, you won't see Michael Myers in this sequel, but it's still watchable.An evil maker somewhere in Northern California provides young children with devilishly made pumpkin masks... need I say more."
"Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology, but the pronoun-laced conversational passages have left me wondering who was on first, or who was the first mate.Conrad was a pathbreaker in the subjects he treated and no doubt had interesting experiences, but I prefer his other works."
"Having tested many books that deal with the SAT I was positively surprised by the depth this book provided. The problem is the fact that the sample questions in it do not really reflect the real SAT-test and can only be used to study the math or the critical thinking skills.Also, dont plan to use this book to brush up your vocabulary - the included word-list provides you with only the meanings of the words and not with a sample sentence.This book might be suitable for usage in combination with 10 Real SATs or some other book that features more realistic SAT questions."
Given as a gift today to go with recipients coffee maker.They used it for their guests same day (!) and really likedappreciated the size and quality of the pitcher. It's a perfectsize to give you the option of quantity to make.
"When you are at a loss to communicate, much less comfort a friend who has experienced a death, this book can speak for you! Consider giving it as a gift, more personal and more everlasting than flowers. If you have lost a loved one, take this book as your own companion to help you move through your grief. Someone who understands is waiting in this book to support your journey. It will help."
"The back cover states ""Thoroughly updated for it's Fourth Edition"". Not true. The only difference between this and the 3rd edition is that the three Clinical Problem sets at the back of the 3rd edition (pages 347-383) have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the Maintenance of Certification Primer (pages 345-375). In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7, the Pictorial Atlas, is unchanged. And I suspect the same will be true for the 4 online practice exams. Bottom line - buy the 3rd edition used for about $2 and save yourself $60. Still, this book is ok for FP boards as is Swanson's."
The powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the 90 degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit. I wish I would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection. Tis junk and can't use it. Money wasted.
Better than 2002 tour - BUT GUYS NEED AN UP TO DATE WITH CURRENT VERSIONS OF YOUR MUSIC - like a 2012 dvd.....PLEASE! Love them!!
"I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were , basically, thrown out when this movie was made. I was so disappointed. I will not watch this sequel again. If you really liked the first two movies, I would not bother to watch the 3rd. It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line."
"I definitley give 'Eragon' a -5* star. I would if it were an option.Some well known 'funnies' to eragon1. Aria and Eragon will probably turn out to be brother and sister.2. Eragon is mad at Murtagh for being not 'merciful' enough, and later in the book is happy that murtaggh is such a 'merciless' fighter.3. Guess what story this is: A boy and an older man go off for an adventure! Nope! YOUR WRONG! Its not star wars!4. Aragorn and Arwen, Eragon and Aria? Call me crazy.. but they sound familar...I'm sorry I wasted 3 hours reading this book"
"This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it. It was my hope to read about the settlers moving West on the old Oregon Trail but this book had nothing to do with that. Instead, it was an account of Parkman's experiences as he traveled in some of the Western areas of the U.S. (Wyoming area, Black Hills, etc.) Much of his time was spent with the various Indian tribes as he befriended them and learned much of their culture. He also spent a great deal of time hunting. My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive. Many of the accounts were similar and it seemed like we were going over and over the same thing. I read almost every thing I can find on Western adventure and exploration but this one is sure not on the top of my list."
"If I had opened the box before I gave the Club Champ Putt 'n Return Putting Mat as a gift, I would have returned it. Disappointed in the quality and durabiity. Would not recommend."
"I'm sure if I had received it instead of the cloth map that was sent, I would have loved it. I returned the map and asked that the light be sent as originally ordered. This never happened and I ended up asking for a refund."
I bought this book on tape as read by the author. It is excruciating to listen to. Don't get this! I should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author!!
"The candy we received was not edible. It had long ago expired. We requested a refund, but it never came through. Avoid this vendor."
"Seriously, this book is just convoluted and boring. I can't believe this is called a classic. Its terrible and the educators at certain high schools should not force this book upon kids--it lowers their grades and intelligence."
Great videos!!!! I'm a former labor and delivery nurse. The videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer. The videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch! They helped my daughter prepare for her first labor and delivery experience. They also helped review and update me on current L and D practices. Thanks for a wonderful product!
"Yellow plastic not matched to metal portions perfectly, but okay. It was good for the price. Still don't know what the reference to gerber was."
"This movie was okay. I have it 1 star because it lacked in suspense and acting. I am sure people would have liked it better if it never had anything to do with Halloween and it was an independent movie! But no, the stupid writters had to install this horrible peice of junk. The only reason i have this movie is because I want to have all the Halloweens. But I want to actually watch Girlfriends or Ally McBeal while I am watching this. I did not like it. BORING !!!!I advise you carefully, watch Halloween 4 instead.I advice"
"I have lots of these , using them almost daily as underware . my first pair having purchased at least 6 years ago. my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes . seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control . won't be buying again"
"Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!"
"Man was I upset when this thing ended after just three hours. For anyone who's ever worked in a big glass skyscraper this film is truly cathartic. I think it is too narrow to focus on the journalistic or the tobacco-industry elements of The Insider. Like HEAT before it, Mann's film is a highly dramatized portrayal of ethics in the modern world. Truly a remarkable film that earns everything it asks for from the audience. On a lesser note, I also think it is something really unique when big-budget Hollywood productions such as this one eschew explosions and spaceships to focus on telling a human story. Cheesy as it may sound, I believe a film like this is much closer to gargantuan filmaking than... well let's justs say GLADIATOR."
"My boys, ages 5 and 7, can't get their fill of this colorful, wacky book. The love indulging their imaginations with it each night before bed and ""sweet thirds and fourths"" of it in a single sitting would not be enough if they had their way!"
"I agree with Pork Chop T. Boring. No character development and a weird repetition of what would hopefully been a plot. I added a collection on my Kindle called ""Rejects""."
"This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys, mainly Syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff, trying to bring something new in terms of music. If you are a real fan this would be very rare and interesting but if you expect the late sound of PF with Waters and Gilmour maybe you will feel quite shocked. I rated it 4 because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important, the real value of the video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music."
"This antenna may work for some people, but for me it was another regrettable purchase. The assembly is fairly easy, but the results proved a letdown. I bought the Terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the Samsung DTB-H260F set top box I am using to bring in free OTA digital and HD stations. But I tried two different positions with the Terk and its 10db amp was only able to bring in three or four local DT stations at best. Analog reception proved even worse. When I took off the Terk and replaced it with a coventionally-designed, less expensive indoor antenna with a 45db amp in those same positions, the difference in performance was amazing...I could get between 12 and 15 DT channels. In conclusion, my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification. It's that extra power that made the difference for me. Sorry Terk..."
Oratory ingestion is not recommended. I decided to eat some of my Uranium last week and experienced some unwanted side-effects. I now go by the name General Zorg AND YOU SHALL BOW DOWN TO ME AND MY MUTANT POWERS!!!
"I have been using this product for a few weeks. I have a ceramic tea pot that I use to make a few cups of tea at a time, and the tea was getting cold way too quickly. This product keeps my whole pot of tea nice and warm for as long as it takes me to drink -- which has been up to about six hours. I'm getting ready to buy a second one for my tea cup, so my tea stays warm once I pour it from the tea pot."
This book is an old favorite love the old movie and loved re reading about simpler times comforting and enjoyable easy reading with some funny times Happy sad and is good to get lost in am sight impaired and have not long had my Kindle It is fantastic amozon have been great and easy to use This book was one of my first and I am really enjoying the story of The March Family their ups and down and will look forward to reading the next in the series
"All right, Adjust well on the bike, however I think the original has a best presentation and even better fit, I should clarify that there is nothing wrong with this device and it is too early to assess its performance, is currently installed and working well in general I have no complaints."
"I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."
I thoroughly enjoyed both of Jan Goldsteins books. Both left me wanting more stories from him. Characters are alive and make you care about them almost immediately. I would recommend All That Matters to anyone and everyone.
"I agree with other users.... If you read the TIVO recommended wireless network adapters, this adapter will not work in TIVO because AMAZON is going to ship you out V.2. V.2 does not work, and V.1 is not longer made. I suggest you just order the TIVO brand.... that's what I did, after trying numerous others.and YES, I have a brand new unit with the latest software, that's NOT the issue."
"I love these guys! Finally, a comedy based on my generation and humor. These guys aren't afraid to put it out there or say whatever is on their minds. If you like silly, stupid, raunchy; then this show is for you."
"This game is horrible. The battles are so... long, slow and unexciting. The scenery is cute, but alittle dark for GBA.Don't waste your money."
"I was terrifically moved by this recording, and Tom Brokaw was the least of it. The supporting cast really throws themselves into the letters from The Greatest Generation. Nothing is hokey or excessive, but the honest human sentiment is tough to resist.By contrast, Tom Brokaw sounds like he's phoning in his part of the script. But he has comparatively little to do here. The heavy lifting is done by the professional narrator and actors. A stunner. It's impossible to recommend this edition too highly."
I went to target today to purchase this boppy. Apparently it has been recalled and they took all the other ones off the shelf. I don't know why it has been recalled yet but I wanted to warn the amazon buyers first.
"This is an absolutely phenomenal video account of Alaska! The videography, music, and narration combine to make this a relaxing and educational viewing experience all wrapped up in one. My family and I truly enjoyed watching this video together, and it definitely made us want to travel to Alaska at some point ourselves! Thanks for sharing your trip and obvious love and respect for our natural wonders!"
"Like everyone else, I waited for tweleve years for this book.. and I ran out and bought it as soon as I could.I want my money and my nine hours back.The characters are bland. There was no plot, no twists, and just about nothing happening that wasn't either easy to foresee or a rehash of books one through four.Wait till book six comes out, then pick this one up in paperback and skim it. Trust me, I'm trying to save you the anguish of characters you can't get into, events that are just plain silly, and the endless retelling of events that you don't need to be told about if you bothered to read the rest of the series."
"This little slipcover for my keyboard has saved the day for our family! I feel safe leaving my 3 year old alone with his drinks watching my laptop now that he understands to keep the keyboard protector on. Really frees me up and helps me not worry about him ruining my computer so much anymore. It would be even better if the edges were sticky enough to hold the cover on more securely, but as is gives me much peace of mind. I think everyone should have one of these!"
"I was tired of having to pick up my Day-Timer every time I wanted to view it, with this stand I can leave it at the corner of my desk and view it at an easy angle to see without ever having to pick it up. It is sturdy enough to write on and has storage space below for stationary & letterhead. My only complaint is the high price, I would have bought a different brand if I could have found the same thing cheaper."
"This book was written to instruct and encourage young people (men, in those days--but it can apply to anyone) to live a simple and productive life. Franklin learned early the unpleasantness of being in debt and in trouble with others, and made for himself a rule of life, which he strove daily to adhere to. He quickly learned that advice from others can be mistaken and the necessity of evaluating what others prescribed. He gives a good account of a prudent life, but does not spare himself, clearly declaring when he was at fault or mistaken. I wish I had read this when I was young--I might have been more consistent and productive."
I like this show. But then again I like Sy-fi. Amanda Tapping is a good actress. Enjoyed her in StarGate SG1. And in the show sanctuary she does a great english imitation..
I just got to tell you that I was just bored to tears watching this long and stupid movie. This one doesn't earn the rights for an Academy Award :-(
"EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors, and existing reviews (Jose Lima 2007, Larkenfield 2007) mentioned separately insulated wires and gold-plated connectors, so that's what I originally thought I was going to get.The cable I received had nickel-plated connectors; it did not have separately insulated wires. It worked, but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and I've long since thrown the cable away.Given at least one other reviewer of this product (Joseph Z. Singer 2012) didn't get what they expected based on the product description, I think it's safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable. If I were you, I'd buy from another shipper."
"This review relates to the Heritage 1944 edition...Heritage's Life on the Mississippi features a dusky green slipcase; book is covered in textured green cloth with a riverboat emblem. Over 40 Thomas Hart Benton illustrations in color and black & white.Includes ""a number of previously suppressed passages, now printed for the first time and edited with a note from Willis Wager.""418 pp, decorated cloth over hardback boards, sewn binding."
this is a throuogh explanation on the state of the African American. it is a worthwhile book for anyone intersted in African Amrican people. it is a brillant book writtn by a brillant writer. it worth buying and reading it.
"Written 50 years ago, this uniquely-styled novel, with multi-page single paragraph passages apparently used to render community scenes in a unified format seems to me to be a kind of impressionist painting in words, sliding fluidly between a smallish back country city on the edge of the desert and an island village in the upper reaches of the Amazon, with a motley population of mostly poor but proud peasants and indians, some living by smuggling contraband, others by the central elaborate [...] house where an old harp player leads a combo of local musicians. The hopes and fears, successes and failures, of the protagonists translate neither to heroes nor villains, and sad or happy events follow each other in timeless progression. The respected writer produced subsequent superior works, but this difficult effort still deserves patronage."
I bought these when they were deal of the day for around $15. Can't complain about a deal like that. In response to the reviewers who said to order a size up I'd say maybe order up a half size if you like your slippers fairly loose. When I first got mine I thought they would be too small but after wearing them a couple of days they stretch out and I think they run pretty tru to size. I wouldn't pay $50 for them but if I see them for deal of the day again I'll be buying them for all my family.
"Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power, but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back."
"If you have ever worked in an office environment, you have to see this movie.I've watched this movie over 100 times and I still can't stop laughing.I still use quotes from this movie on a daily basis."
"There's no getting around it: regardless of his actual faith, Joseph Arthur is a Christian folk rocker. Nothing wrong with that, just a fact that grounds the sixteen stellar tracks of his third release Redemption's Son. Though his belief runs deep, the thrill in his work is that his faith doesn't come without continuous struggle. Like his idol (and label-owner) Peter Gabriel, Arthur turns experience of the day-to-day into the epic. Unlike Gabriel, his music is still in touch with the simple verities. He keeps his progressive tendencies in check, relying on solid narrative details and the ragged beauty of his countertenor. The title cut, ""Dear Lord"", ""Evidence"" - each root their moral struggle in a recognizable situation: absentee father, social estrangement, addiction. The drawback is that every song reaches the same conclusion - there's nothing that God can't put right. Still, it's a testament to Arthur's gifts that the end doesn't nullify the journey."
"A classic mystery with plot twists throughout to keep you guessing. Watch for a spell-binding cameo by Stephen Herbster, virtually buried in the credits but more than worthy of praise."
"I 've always liked this release for the following tracks: Ghosts of Cape Horn and Make Way for The Lady. The others are fine too with the sole clunker being the wretched The Auctioneer which is so out of place here. If I want to hear that nonsense, I'll go to a cattle auction. Originally a digital recording, it suffered from tape hiss which is odd for digital(the early days of)recording. The hiss is gone but the recording still doesn't sound right to my ears particularly the vocals. Suprisingly, this is a very short disc clocking in at a paltry 33.50. Another entire release could have easiliy fit on the remainder of the disc. I hate when labels cheat the consumer in that fashion. So be it, still worthwhile for some very good tracks. 10 tracks/full lyrics/33.50."
"I recently purchased 8 of these bras and although I loved the fit, I'm afraid that 4 out of 8 have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra. All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines. I'm greatly disappointed"
"Like many, our family bought this book and the next based on the glowing reviews of the many readers. Unfortunately, we were in for quite a shock as these are the most unimaginative, poorly written books ever published. At Borders where I returned all four books we purchased (2 copies of Eragon and 2 of Eldest), there was a pile of returned copies of Eldest behind the counter. I was in fact unable to get a refund, instead I got store credit on a gift card.Eragon is an uninspiring story chock full of tired, overused characters. The prose is unimaginative, very wordy, and fails miserably on all levels. Each characters talks just like every other character. I don't know why everyone said this book was so good. My kids are in tears. Thanks a lot Chris Paolini for ruining our last week of summer break!"
"I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible, this book is a masterpiece unparalleled."
"This film is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Oh, it's true... What a waste of time! No Mike Myers, Jamie Lee or the Doctor? Why even have ""Halloween"" in the title then? There's absolutely nothing scary here except maybe the acting and cheesy effects. Horrible!! 100% USDA Garbage"
"This book is well worth the time to read, the tone is light but the message is very serious. It is an excellent book but to my tastes it could have been edited into a shorter volume."
"If you are a batman fan this is the movie to see. We start at Bruce Wayne's beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the Dark Knight.The script was approved by DC comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the ""Batman"" movies before it. Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman. Micheal Caine, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman played their characters with the great skill that we've come to expect from these legendary actors. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Dr. Jonathan Crane was amazing and complex. I look forward to the next movie in this remarkable new series."
"THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH GOOD ARTIST AROUND, THAT THEY WOULD NAME A RAPP ARTIST AS BEST OF ANYTHING."
"Mr. brokaw couldn't possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nation.Mr.Brokaw found mostly officers to interview,most of whom went into the service as officers,and later became politicians. Where are the uneducated,poverty stricken youths who went into the armed forces,fought and died for their country, and, those who survived,returned to their former lives little better off than before being drafted? The author never mentioned the fact that machinery is always in place to keep our rich youths out of the service,making their service in our armed forces strictly voluntary; and always as officers,most-repeat-,most of whom never heard a shot fired,the exception proving the rule"
"This AC adapter works great for me with my Apple 15"" Aluminum G4 Powerbook. Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply, but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad, it was a nice touch)."
"If your a die hard fan and saw them all, you may like it, otherwise be warned. It's not good, the twisting of reality with Robert Englund appearing as himself, and Wes Craven's cameo just didn't add the renewal of life that they had hoped. It's not really scary either, which I thought was kind of a requirement in these horror movies."
"i sometimes think of that final list of the finest movies i've ever seen. after much soul searching and viewing films for over 50 years, i narrowed it down to amadeus, private ryan, manchurian candidate (frank sinatra), high noon and no country. after everything shakes out, THE INSIDER would have to top the list. acting, directing, music, script and subject matter. i just wish it was on blu ray."
"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. It gave me even more respect for those of this generation. After reading this book, I had to order Mr. Brokaw's other books."
"Batman Begins was such a relief for Batman fans. Finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction. This one is definitely the 2nd best Batman movie to date.. and I say that because The Dark Knight was just so damn good. Even if you're not a ""superhero"" movie fan, you'll like this one. This takes away the ""supernatural/superhero"" aspects of other comic movies, and turns it more realistic. Highly Recommend."
"I bought this book because I had read 'So You Want to Be a Wizard' (the first book in the series to which this book is the sixth) when I was in elementary school, and for nostalgia's sake, I wanted to read the whole series. The book came in perfect condition (save a few dings in the softcover from shipping). It was well worth the money!!"
"i understand where she was coming from and each of the characters problems. i'm only in eighth grade, but i know that this is real life and how people react to different things. however, the characters didn't do anything about their problems. Carson McCullers must have been dumped or something when she wrote this book because it's very depressing. the thing i don't understand is why people would want to read about real life when we already live it. we all know what life is like so what is the point of this book? it took me so long just to read a chapter. i didn't get into it at all. the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something. the only reason i read it was to get a good grade . well, at least i get $10 for getting an A in my stupid english class. u know how they say, ""never judge a book by it's cover,"" well this book is a way more boring than the cover, take my word for it."
"I have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one. Santa brought this for my daughter, who loves teen titans, for Christmas. The instructions, what there is of them, is very hard to decipher. The orange launch thing would not work and I had to take apart the little red switch that the control thing fits on to make the organge track pop out. (the red switch was not in the right position from factory). Even then the orange track does not fold all the way out. Also, like alot of other reviewers the tower tips over very easily. I just don't feel like I am getting what I am paying for these days when it comes to toys."
"I had a lot of trouble getting this to work with Windows XP, but to all those people out there who are having the same trouble, THIS CARD WILL WORK, it is just a real pain getting it to do so. After spending hours trying myself and using tech support, I figured out the problem on my own. First of all, you must download the XP drivers from the Belkin website. THEN, you need to use the utility that comes on the CD rom, *NOT* the generic one for Windows XP. Besides the setup trouble, the card works fine, the price is right and I have no complaints [now]."
"Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also, multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line."
"I was hoping to find some nice calming, relaxing music to play in my classroom and home. This was a little too instrumentally loud."
"THIS is a HORROR movie. In the same vein as ""Last house on the left"". Well directed and not for sissy horror fans that think ""Scream"" is the first slasher film. Yeah thats a ""good"" movie. But, if ya think ""that"" movie contains the same if not ""equal"" shock value, you need to crawl out of your hole and rent or buy this movie and see what has been stolen{ from such a fine director}.The acting is so amateur that it works in both the comedic range and the serious.The makeup is incredibly real, so that if it had been done in black and white, the film would have been just as effective. And the camerawork, nothing less than brilliant. It's up there with ""Psycho"" the original [Hitchcock] as well as the remake [Gus Van Sandt] This is real Hideyoureyes terror.Made to be ""Watched Alone"" in the dark.In the daylight as well.Beware the Meathook"
"I am very satisfied with the product, it came in a good time and the customer service provided was great."
"Move over Star Wars and make room for this fabulous and wicked movie, the two outragouse creaters of South Park have done it again and pulled out another comedy great. Only that one was actually funny and successful, and the other is a guarenteed qualifier for the WORST movie ever made in the history and the face of this rock we live on. Watch this movie and you're automatically part of somthing special, the other end of the spectrum of what the movie industry has to offer."
Like Eragon...I first watched the movie and really enjoyed it. Afterwards I read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book.I liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action. There was no sex and cussing (that I remember) in the book for those that don't like to read that sort of stuff.On a side note...my inner immaturity laughed when the words 'fagged' and 'ejaculated' were used to describe feelings and expressions.Five stars!
"From a female hardcore lovers point of view: I have just got to say that Hatebreed is amazing. By far one of the best hardcore albums I've heard in a while. THis album is full of raw, true emotion - it makes me aware of where I am with myself as well as with others. Hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound - they truly give it in a way that makes me FEEL the music. It has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back. I would love to thank the band personally for creating and SHARING thier sound with others...and for inspiring me."
"As a child, I grew up in Knoxville, TN watching Dolly Partin on the Cas Walker Farm & Home Show. I remember her singing Bluegrass back then and didn't really appreciate what I was hearing. Unfortunately, she got away from her roots. Now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted CD that has critics and her fans screaming her praises. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited to singing Bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark. The arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable. (As a Tenneseean, I wish she would have included her awesome version of Rocky Top or at least updated it.) Dolly's gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the Grammy's with The Grass is Blue and Trio II. A Top 10 CD if I ever heard one!"
"I am not even done listening to every track yet, yet I know this is the one. Moby pretty much pulls off the album of the year. Artists of the likes of Madonna and Beck will be calling this guy for some of his expertise. He has broken ground by creating a beautiful unexpected hybrid: Gospel/Blues and Electronic music. Forget Fatboy Slim, or Slim Shady or Will Smith, get with Moby, and get with him now. ""Play"" not only rocks your mind, but touches your soul....All without putting you to sleep, being illegal, or selling you out.(Headphones recommended)"
"If you'd like to learn the entire hierarchy of old native american and Latin american cultures than this is the book for you. Dispersed facts about each culture that could be interesting if tied together and actually filled the book make it worth perusing. However, the book is entirely too long and filled with drivel consistent with reading a list of kings for every country in Europe for the last 3,000 years. Information about each king would be written out and spoken as fact, though when the source behind the information is given you begin forming some serious doubts about the authenticity of it all."
"This is just pethetic! I don't get the point of watching the movie. There was abot hmm... 2..3 funny parts that don't EVEN GO WITH THE MOVIE! Even my dad fell asleep in the movie. I should'nt even tell you the stroy. It's so STUPID! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT! IF you buy, I hope you enjoy being bored."
"First off....I am the biggest fan of Halloween of all time, and I love Halloween III Season of the Witch! It may not have Michael Myers in it, but it still has that John Carpenter innovativness and plot making it a classic. The movie does have its share of blood and gore, but still relies on suspense and carefully planned scares. The cast may be rather low budget, but still manages to pull off a good horror flick. Those who trashed this movie need to open their minds and realize what a classic this is! I highly recommend it!"
"I own several dozen Christmas Jazz CD's. How did I miss this one for so long? It's a winner from begining to end. The Trio really delivers some tasty versions of your favorite Christmas standards. Each nugget features a unique take on the song without straying too far from the original sound. Very upbeat and lively thtoughout. Not your standard, elevator jazz."
"Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next, it seemed to drone on by without a certain explanation. I loved the book, it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without. Besides that, Count of Monte Cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself. It had such passion and devotion inside it; it's as though Dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as Dantes."
Not as magical and is darker than the first 3 movies. Overall it was a great movie!!!The ending leaves you anxious to see the next film!!!
"Continuing right where Season 2 left off with the murder of Agent Todd, the team adds 2 new members to their cast. The new director is named Jenny and has a previous relationship with Gibbs and the new agent is named Ziva."
"The first four books, as they originally came out, followed a consistent and attractive design pattern, thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing. The new binding looks completely different -- simplistic, boring -- and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books. I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design. The decision makers at Crown Publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best television show on television and if you missed the first season you can catch up on what happened now with these awsome videos. It is good formatted and is a must for a buffy fanatic like myself...all of the books are good too!
"I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest."
"This movie really is a complete stinkpot.The acting is horrible,the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable,and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy. First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene/war flashback. No story what so ever. The car chase scene is so full of it, a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like 500 times and is still driving around. Even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out. Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ...."
"Very well done. Both on the part of the Japanese war plans, as well as our own. I lived in that era and remember the situation very well. I would recommend this movie to all aages."
"Two days after I finished this I thought -- hey, wait a minute, she never explained just how the anti-semite group just happened to have a knife with Tara's blood on it to conveniently plant in the teacher's car. They supposedly didn't know who did it so how do they explain having the murder weapon? Did anyone else pick up on that and if so, did she explain it anywhere?"
"This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes, not even at the bottom of the page. You will notice that this book is only 194 pages, whereas I recently found a very good used copy that is 378 pages. Both are unabridged, but in this edition the text is crammed onto the pages. Also, just scanning through the book today I quickly found two typos. Avoid this cheaply constructed edition. I sincerely hope Amazon stops selling it."
I had high hopes for this movie.I actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent.It wasn't.It was pure garbage.I had to leave this movie after the first 30 minutes.Its that bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.
"not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ... I would say not half good. I can say they have great talent, but artistically ... wrong managed. Stopped watching after 30 min."
"This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that's a minor thing. Also doesn't have the easy-to-use cable-wrapping things on the original, but once again, that's a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase."
That boy mike jones is about to get what is coming to him. He running around houston claiming he the king of the streets boy please. If anyone want to hear some real underground rap from houston go get that Chamillionaire (The MixTape Messiah) cause that is a true mc that should be out there cus Dike Jones -Who- Dike Jones his album is never coming soon. He has been saying that it is coming soon since 2002 but all he has done is put out two trash cds before he would even put out the cd he been talking about for two years. now he about to put out a cd with Paul Wall Called -The Future- but where in the hell is His Solo album. Oh Yeah it coming soon since 2002. Paul Wall messed when he turned his back on Chamillionaire but That Mixtape Messiah pt.2 expose this fraud ni--as. So go get that Chamillionaire The Mixtape Messiah. SO you can remember what real underground music is. Hiram Clarke Tx.
This is a classic that can be read over and over. Good for reading aloud to the kids on trips too.

A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced. If cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the DVD. One good aspect of the movie; Ewan & Susan Lynch's rendition of 'The Lass of Aughrim'...but you can download that.
"As an accompaniment to the program MacLogic for an upper level course I can see where this book would have a place. Unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class. The material is well written and organized but far too densely written, particularly for students who have never had a logic class before and are coming from questionable mathematics backgrounds. That there is no index of symbols just makes navigating the text that much more difficult.On another level, the author seems to eschew a good many things that many other logic courses--at least those I've seen and taken--use in depth. Things like Modus Ponens are barely touched on in favor of ""v E"" (disjunction elimination). This seems unusual for an introductory textbook in the field, though I am not familiar enough to know for certain."
I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
"It is possible I got a defective ball, but I bought this with the intention of using it for p90x2. I inflated it following the directions precisely, but I found it nearly impossible to perform most of the exercises because the ball compressed so much. It is very high quality and was nearly odorless, but I highly suggest going for a cheaper ball (I'm now using a TKO ball) that is more firm."
"Well, I have to say that I didn't really want to write a negative Sunny Day review, but then I thought of the unfortunate lads who would waste their money on this CD instead of buying a different Sunny Day CD. I am a big fan (driving 6 hours to see them play in a couple weeks) but I was kinda let down by this one. Diary and Self-Titled are strongly recommended."
"I've had this windshield mount for a few months now, and while it works, I can't really say that I would recommend it to anyone else.As the other review said, it shakes quite a bit while driving. However, that is bearable compared to the real problem--the pivot head is just not very sturdy. Hitting the smallest bumps on the road, or even just turning, could cause the pivot head to swivel, leaving your PSP in a slanted position.The pivot head swivels while driving whether or not I have the PSP docked in the windshield mount, so it's not an issue of weight. I end up having to adjust its position every few minutes, which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving."
"The attempt to make another Destroyer fell very short. The title track is easily the best song on this album. It was obvious right away that Peter Criss wasn't playing on it....he does't have that kind of talent so why go in and make this album at all? Before it even came out you knew that Peter would be singing a ballad. ""I Finally Found My Way"" is no ""Beth"" or ""Hard Luck Woman."" The rest of it is just too soft. There is no heavy drum sound. It almost like a weak Lick It Up minus the better songs. Get back with Eric and Bruce! Don't worry about makinganother Destroyer. I'll be satisfied with another Revenge."
"Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them."
"This true story takes place in the early to middle 1800's and its location on Nantucket Island and in the middle of nowhere..asea. You learn that looking for whales is a group effort and when one is found, a grueling and dangerous activity to land it. The ship Essex was sunk by a whale and that was the inspiration for writing Moby Dick. It is most interesting reading about the survival of a few and how they eventually made it back to land. A pageturner."
I don't remember ever seeing my nephews play with this toy.I'm sure I didn't pay much for it but the excitement for this toy didn't last too long after the initial opening on Christmas eve.
"They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically, a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped."
"I bought this tent for my 16 month old for Christmas. We were so excited when it arrived that we put it together early! We bought it for $24 and I think we're definitely getting our money's worth! Very durable, perfect size! He likes to put a chair in it and watch movies!"
"Loved this movie! Would have given it five stars if there had been a little romance thrown in. It was very good, even so."
"with all the add on to this game a simple versus DLC that allows you to play up to four or even two players in your house (split screen) would be good, but no they made it online only or one player so no internet no fun. it's not worth it, buy any other burnout except this one. and if you want to have fun wreaking cars and people get (Saints Row The Third) or (Grand Theft Auto) you can drive around getting into all sorts of trouble. Not a bad idea the open land driving but we see that in the GTA's this is Burnout the open land should be the addition"
"Been listening to the book for the last two weeks so I feel like I'm family. Doesn't get 5 stars because it gets a little too in love with its own voice, but for the most part a really good audio book."
"I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera (Minolta DiMAGE 7i) but it does not work ! The card works fine on my PC, but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam. I guess SimpleTech must be aware of the problem since their tech support e-mailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one, but of course I had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card, so I hope this might help some potential buyers..."
This item is too short besides being too small. It doesn't fit well at all. At least it didn't cost too much.
"I think it was a good book because the story was very interesting and easy to read . The message of the novel is very important important because it relates to ancient times, morden times and the future you must read this book."
"This movie had bad acting. The dad is dramactic and corney. The mom is just corney, and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship. The olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch. This movie is unrealistic that Emma (ashley) and Sam Mary Kate were on 2 different teams. (It's a rule that siblings be on same sports team) This movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot."
"I ordered a widescreen version from this retailer. Not only did I get a fullscreen version in the mail (along with an invoice that confirmed I ordered the widescreen), the DVD would not play in any player I owned (which is 4). Tried to get in touch with customer service, but after a nightmare and a long headache I decided to just give up my ten dollars as lost and buy the film at Best Buy. Don't use this retailer!!!"
"While Tolkien was nowhere near as excellent of a writer at this point as he would become years later with the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit is still an enjoyable introduction to Middle Earth. The story is more simple and the flow is more like reading a fable or children's story to me compared with the more serious and high fantasy style of the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is more fast paced. There is more action happening all the time but it's not as atmospheric. This is the story of Bilbo joining a band of dwarves to go get treasure from a dragon named Smaug. Along the way he braves many dangers such as orcs, trolls, giant spiders and meets Gollum and finds a ring. It's a good prelude but nothing amazing. However, the book does hold a special place for me because I found a copy in my parents book collection in the basement when I was a kid and it became the first book I ever read. I owe Tolkien a thank you for hooking me on books."
"At first I didn't really care for this album, but after a couple of listens, I love it. Neo-soul is here to stay and Musiq is the greatest. My favorite tracks are Womanopoly, Babymother, Who Knows, and so on. This cd is hot and I can't wait for the next one."
"Love Robert Ingpen's illustrations - they work so well for this story in particular. As far as I can tell, this is not abridged either which is a huge plus. If you want an edition of A Christmas Carol on your shelf, this is definitely a good one."
"I bought this book as an assignment for my moms' book club. I could NOT put it down! If my history books had been this interesting in high school, I probably would have considered majoring in history in college! Gregory's writing is absolutely delicious. She enhances the historical facts with dialogue and really gives you a sense of how these characters lived and interacted. Now I am completely fascinated by historical novels. Another recommendation from my book club is Abundance, about Marie Antoinette. (Even if you don't read it, please know that Marie is NOT the one who said ""Let them eat cake!"" That infamous quote was actually uttered by a man and incorrectly attributed to her. She actually loved the French people.) Anyway, this novel is much better than the movie ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" which I did see, so if you saw the movie you should still read this book to really get the details of the story!"
"I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play."
I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
"The music on this set is fine, as Ms Day always is. However it has a quirk I find distasteful. On the third cd is a hidden track, track 13 to be exact that throws all the songs out of sequence if you rip it. I wouldn't recommend buying this for that reason alone. All the songs are available on other cd's so it's no problem skipping over this one. It seems if they want to mess with people and keep it a secret until after the money is spent then my money will be spent elsewhere."
"I always rely on Amazon customer reviews - this is the first time I have been so completely disappointed. I had to hold the fan 10 inches from my face before I felt any circulating air, and that was with the fan on High. Due to the size and shape of the fan blades, no air comes out of the center of the fan; what little breeze there is comes out in a small stream on the sides of the fan. I won't comment on the light, since I wasn't interested it that option. Just got it, and I am sending it right back."
"All I can say is that every working, healthy and modern kitchen should have a fuzzy logic rice cooker and by buying a good one that will make Porrige and has other modes, you open it up to providing all kinds of wonderful and creative meals."
Bought this item for half or what a local computer store wanted. Worked right out of the box. Very good product.
"After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then, the only solution is to constantly turn it on and off.No lightning have fallen near my house, nor any other extraordinary event have happened.I have looked for help from zoom, internet forums and my ISP company and all of them agreed that it is a hardware problem, apparently a common one if you buy an X6 zoom modem/router.The only definite solution: buy a new modem (not a zoom modem)"
This was a very different type of book from what i'm usesd to. It was very goog.I am a big fan of ellery queen.
An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers. The noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as I turn up the volume knob.
"When I looked at this game without opening it, I thought to myself it reminded me of Roller Coaster Tycoon. The graphics are very detailed and wonderful! I tried and game out. Let me tell you, if you love RollerCoaster Tycoon, you will adore this game!You can build secure exhibits so people can see animals like the elephant, penguin, and sea lion. But be careful. If you don't have a strong enough fence or a fence monkies can't climb out of, or your animals can escape and terrorize your guests!There are many buildings to add to the fun like a Japanese Garden or Animal Show.So all together, the gameplay is pretty much the same as RollerCoaster Tycoon, only this is a zoo instead of a themepark. =o)"
"One can go on forever about who is pro this or pro that, but the truth is that the most complete and recognized book on the subject of the Liberty is written by Jay Cristol, a United States Judge who has devoted his life to the FACTS of what went on that day. This book shows one side, from an emotional person who was hurt and angry. If you read this book, you do yourself and history a disservice if you do not read Jay Cristol's book as well. I was ""horrified"" by the incident, as any American would be, until I read the explanations and facts addressed by Judge Cristol. Seemingly impossible facts to refute, mentioned in this book, have complicated but indisputable answers. A country fighting for its life does not brutally attack its ONLY ally in the world. There are answers, and this book does not have them. Judge Cristol's book does."
"this product is good, haven't had any concern or problem with yet.latching it to the car is alright since my car is decent one/"
"This movie was better when it was called ""Ben Hur."" And I hated ""Ben Hur."" The effects here were so overdone, the computer-generated scenery so artificial, I felt ill. Computer imagery ought to be used only when necessary, and with a budget like this clunkers,' real scenery would have been easy. The acting was fair, I'll admit, but the script so trite and forced one wonders why the actors even bother. Oh, yeah....money. This movie is all hype. bleckt"
"This one isn't really ""science fiction,"" since, with only changes, it could be set in the here-and-now, or in Ruritania -- but it's pure Heinlein, and better written than many of his earlier works. At only 128 pages, it's also pretty short for a novel -- but it works. Lorenzo Smyth (a/k/a Larry Smith) is an actor convinced of his own talent (which, as it turns out, is actually considerable) who is hired to impersonate the Good Guy leader of a major political alliance, who has been kidnaped on Mars by the Evil Opposition. Against his better apolitical judgment, Lorenzo takes the job because it's a challenge, and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely. There's a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort Heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions, with the quietly-made exception of a plea for racial tolerance."
"...it's about being ""proud of being the first Danish woman to do so"" - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details). Krakauer and Boukreev run circles around this lady, definitely NOT recommended"
"It came very fast and the quality is very good, would buy from this seller again if they anything that I want. Thanks"
"Another winner for Jance in the Joanna Brady series. I have read all of the books in the series and am currently reading the next installment, Dead Wrong. I love the Joanna Brady series and will not miss one. Jance has got a real winner here. I like this series far more that the J.P. Beaumont series. Also, there is no need to read the other books in the series before picking up this one. Jance brings everyone up to speed without any confusion if you start a book in the middle of the series. Great characterizations and storyline."
"This movie has an excellent story (better than the first). First rate acting, direction, and special effects. In my estimation, this is better than the first!"
"Fearless meets the Sixth Sense. Except that Fearless was excellent and the Sixth Sense was good. This movie is bad. Hathaway and Wilson have absolutely zero chemistry and all they do is blab on and on about nothing. The other characters walk in and out then disappear, only we hardly realize that since they're barely on screen for more than a minute at a time. By the time the end hits - all involved are greatly relieved that it's over. For everyone."
How can you go wrong with a Ray Bradbury story....I sent this to my 17 year old grandson as an introduction to other fiction.
"I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect."
"Wow. I've never seen so much ""borrowing"" done. It's amazing!In my opinion, this should not be allowed to happen, but evidently I must be in the minority. Perhaps most people are not so well read as I and think that this book is in some way original. In my opinion, it is in no way original. There are borrowings from every major work of fantasy and most minor ones. It's really distracting as you attempt to read. This is one of the few books that I have started and could just not continue with. It was truely horrid. Wonderful beginners work, I guess and great for a seventeen year old, but why publish it?"
"Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in our society. A must read by ever parent while their son is growing up. If you like this book, try Go West Old Man by Max Barnet, a true tale about a father/son trip across the country in a pickup truck, discovering each other, including their needs. A clash of generations resolving."
"We recently organised a pot luck for our team an I selected this as gift. I sticked yellow note sticker all over the dvd case and left the words ""WORK SUCKS"" visible out side. when one of my co worker picked this gift and read read the sentence there was a big laugh in the room. and when he opened (removed the stickers) every one said it was the perfect gift with perfect packing for the occasion.Anyway movie is one of my favourite and must watch."
"studied the asvab few days before taking the test. this book helped me get an idea of the difficulty and what to expect in the test. the practice tests on this book is actually harder than the actual asvab, so it helped me to study harder versions. passed with a score of 94."
